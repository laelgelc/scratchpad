We\u2019ve now had more and bigger deficits in the 4 years you\u2019ve been in office. Mr. President, do you have a secret plan to balance the budget sometime in a second term, and if so, would you lay out that plan for us tonight?"}

RIDINGS","Speaker":"The President","Text":"It is true that earlier, working with some very prominent economists, I had come up, during the campaign, with an economic program that I thought could rectify the great problems confronting us \u2014 the double-digit inflation, the high tax rates that I think were hurting the economy, the stagflation that we were undergoing. Before even the election day, something that none of those economists had even predicted had happened, that the economy was so worsened that I was openly saying that what we had thought on the basis of our plan could have brought a balanced budget \u2014 no, that was no longer possible."}
{"Title":"October 7, 1984 Debate Transcript","Debate":"The First Reagan-Mondale Presidential Debate","Date":"October 7, 1984","Participants":"Reagan-Mondale","Moderators":"MS. RIDINGS","Speaker":"The President","Text":"So, the plan that we have had and that we are following is a plan that is based on growth in the economy, recovery without inflation, and reducing the share that the Government is taking from the gross national product, which has become a drag on the economy."}
{"Title":"October 7, 1984 Debate Transcript","Debate":"The First Reagan-Mondale Presidential Debate","Date":"October 7, 1984","Participants":"Reagan-Mondale","Moderators":"MS. RIDINGS","Speaker":"The President","Text":"Already, we have a recovery that has been going on for about 21 months to the point that we can now call it an expansion. Under that, this year, we have seen a $21 billion reduction in the deficit from last year, based mainly on the increased revenues the Government is getting without raising tax rates."}
{"Title":"October 7, 1984 Debate Transcript","Debate":"The First Reagan-Mondale Presidential Debate","Date":"October 7, 1984","Participants":"Reagan-Mondale","Moderators":"MS. RIDINGS","Speaker":"The President","Text":"Our tax cut, we think, was very instrumental in bringing about this economic recovery. We have reduced inflation to about a third of what it was. The interest rates have come down about 9 or 10 points and, we think, must come down further. In the last 21 months, more than 6 million people have gotten jobs \u2014 there have been created new jobs for those people to where there are now 105 million civilians working, where there were only 99 million before; 107, if you count the military."}
{"Title":"October 7, 1984 Debate Transcript","Debate":"The First Reagan-Mondale Presidential Debate","Date":"October 7, 1984","Participants":"Reagan-Mondale","Moderators":"MS. RIDINGS","Speaker":"The President","Text":"So, we believe that as we continue to reduce the level of government spending \u2014 the increase, rate of increase in government spending, which has come down from 17 to 6 percent, and, at the same time, as the growth in the economy increases the revenues the Government gets, without raising taxes, those two lines will meet. And when they meet, that is a balanced budget."}

{"Title":"October 7, 1984 Debate Transcript","Debate":"The First Reagan-Mondale Presidential Debate","Date":"October 7, 1984","Participants":"Reagan-Mondale","Moderators":"MS. RIDINGS","Speaker":"The President","Text":"The deficit is the result of excessive government spending. I do not, very frankly, take seriously the Congressional Budget Office projections, because they have been wrong on virtually all of them, including the fact that our recovery wasn\u2019t going to take place to begin with. But it has taken place."}
{"Title":"October 7, 1984 Debate Transcript","Debate":"The First Reagan-Mondale Presidential Debate","Date":"October 7, 1984","Participants":"Reagan-Mondale","Moderators":"MS. RIDINGS","Speaker":"The President","Text":"But, as I said, we have the rate of increase in government spending down to 6 percent. If the rate of increase in government spending can be held at 5 percent \u2014 we\u2019re not far from there \u2014 by 1989 that would have reduced the budget deficits down to a $30 or $40 billion level. At the same time, if we can have a 4-percent recovery continue through that same period of time, that will mean \u2014 without an increase in tax rates \u2014 that will mean $400 billion more in government revenues. And so, I think that the lines can meet."}

MONDALE","Text":"I respect the President; I respect the Presidency, and I think he knows that. But the fact of it is, every estimate by this administration about the size of the deficit has been off by billions and billions of dollars. As a matter of fact, over 4 years, they\u2019ve missed the mark by nearly $600 billion. We were told we would have a balanced budget in 1983. It was $200 billion deficit instead. And now we have a major question facing the American people as to whether we\u2019ll deal with this deficit and get it down for the sake of a healthy recovery."}

MONDALE","Text":"Virtually every economic analysis that I\u2019ve heard of, including the distinguished Congressional Budget Office, which is respected by, I think, almost everyone, says that even with historically high levels of economic growth, we will suffer a $263 billion deficit. In other words, it doesn\u2019t converge as the President suggests. It gets larger even with growth."}

Our rural and farm friends will have continued devastation. Real interest rates \u2014 the real cost of interest \u2014 will remain very, very high, and many economists are predicting that we\u2019re moving into a period of very slow growth because the economy is tapering off and may be a recession. I get it down to a level below 2 percent of gross national product with a policy that\u2019s fair. I\u2019ve stood up and told the American people that I think it\u2019s a real problem, that it can destroy long-term economic growth, and I\u2019ve told you what I think should be done."}

WIEGHART","Text":"Mr. Mondale, one other way to attack the deficit is further reductions in spending. The President has submitted a number of proposals to Congress to do just that, and in many instances the House, controlled by the Democrats, has opposed them. Isn\u2019t it one aspect of leadership for prominent Democrats such as yourself to encourage responsible reductions in spending, and thereby reduce the deficit?"}

And there are other ways of squeezing this budget without constantly picking on our senior citizens and the most vulnerable in American life. And that\u2019s why the Congress, including the Republicans, have not gone along with the President\u2019s recommendations."}

{"Title":"October 7, 1984 Debate Transcript","Debate":"The First Reagan-Mondale Presidential Debate","Date":"October 7, 1984","Participants":"Reagan-Mondale","Moderators":"MS. RIDINGS","Speaker":"THE PRESIDENT","Text":"Yes. I don\u2019t believe that Mr. Mondale has a plan for balancing the budget; he has a plan for raising taxes. And, as a matter of fact, the biggest single tax increase in our nation\u2019s history took place 1977. And for the 5 years previous to our taking office, taxes doubled in the United States, and the budgets increased $318 billion. So, there is no ratio between taxing and balancing a budget. Whether you borrow the money or whether you simply tax it away from the people, you\u2019re taking the same amount of money out of the private sector, unless and until you bring down government\u2019s share of what it is taking."}

And of course, what happened right after the election is they proposed to cut Social Security benefits by 25 percent \u2014 reducing the adjustment for inflation, cutting out minimum benefits for the poorest on Social Security, removing educational benefits for dependents whose widows were trying \u2014 with widows trying to get them through college.

And 3 days after the election in 1982, they came to us and said, Social Security, we know, is broke. Indeed, we had to borrow $17 billion to pay the checks.

And they have been using these things to have government, through court orders, inhibit the practice of religion. A child wants to say grace in a school cafeteria and a court rules that they can\u2019t do it because it\u2019s school property.

That\u2019s why my proposal protects everybody from $25,000 a year or less against any tax increases, and treats those $70,000 and under in a way that is more beneficial than the way the President proposes with a sales tax or a flat tax."}

There\u2019s another part of the lopsided economy that we\u2019re in today, and that is that these heavy deficits have killed exports and are swamping the Nation with cheap imports.

There is a connection between interest rates and inflation, but I would call to your attention that in 1981 while we were operating still on the Carter-Mondale budget that we inherited \u2014 that the interest rates came down from 21\\1\/2\\, down toward the 12 or 13 figure. And while they were coming down, the deficits had started their great increase. They were going up.

I will grant you that interest rates were too high in 1980, and we can have another debate as to why \u2014 energy prices and so on. There\u2019s no way of glossing around that. But when these huge deficits went in place in 1981, what\u2019s called the real interest rates \u2014 the spread between inflation and what a loan costs you doubled \u2014 and that\u2019s still the case today.

RIDINGS","Speaker":"THE PRESIDENT","Text":"We have \u2014 our military, the morale is high. I think the people should understand that two-thirds of the defense budget pays for pay and salary, or pay and pension. And then you add to that food and wardrobe, and all the other things, and you only have a small portion going for weapons. But I am determined that if ever our men are called on, they should have the best that we can provide in the manner of tools and weapons. There has been reference to expensive spare parts, hammers costing $500. Well, we are the ones who found those."}

RIDINGS","Speaker":"THE PRESIDENT","Text":"I think we\u2019ve given the American people back their spirit. I think there\u2019s an optimism in the land and a patriotism, and I think that we\u2019re in a position once again to heed the words of Thomas Paine, who said: \u201cWe have it in our power to begin the world over again.\u201d"}

MONDALE","Text":"I want to thank the League of Women Voters and the city of Louisville for hosting this evening\u2019s debate. I want to thank President Reagan for agreeing to debate. He didn\u2019t have to, and he did, and we all appreciate it."}

MONDALE","Text":"The President\u2019s favorite question is: Are you better off? Well, if you\u2019re wealthy, you\u2019re better off. If you\u2019re middle income, you\u2019re about where you were. And if you\u2019re modest income, you\u2019re worse off. That\u2019s what the economists tell us."}

MONDALE","Text":"But is that really the question that should be asked? Isn\u2019t the real question is will we be better off? Will our children be better off? Are we building the future that this nation needs? I believe that if we ask those questions that bear on our future, not just congratulate ourselves but challenge us to solve those problems, you\u2019ll see that we need new leadership."}

MONDALE","Text":"Are we better of with this arms race? Will we be better off if we start this star wars escalation into the heavens? Are we better off when we deemphasize our values in human rights? Are we better off when we load our children with this fantastic debt? Would fathers and mothers feel proud of themselves if they loaded their children with debts like this nation is now \u2014 over a trillion dollars on the shoulders of our children? Can we say, really say that we will be better off when we pull away from sort of that basic American instinct of decency and fairness?"}

MONDALE","Text":"I would rather lose a campaign about decency than win a campaign about self-interest. I don\u2019t think this nation is composed of people who care only for themselves. And when we sought to assault Social Security and Medicare, as the record shows we did, I think that was mean-spirited. When we terminated 400,000 desperate, hopeless, defenseless Americans who were on disability \u2014 confused and unable to defend themselves, and just laid them out on the street, as we did for 4 years, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s what America is all about."}

MONDALE","Text":"I believe that we will be better off if we protect this environment. And contrary to what the President says, I think their record on the environment is inexcusable and often shameful. These laws are not being enforced, have not been enforced, and the public health and the air and the water are paying the price. That\u2019s not fair for our future."}
