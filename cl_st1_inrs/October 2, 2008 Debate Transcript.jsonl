Never will we be exploited and taken advantage of again by those who are managing our money and loaning us these dollars. We need to make sure that we demand from the federal government strict oversight of those entities in charge of our investments and our savings and we need also to not get ourselves in debt. Let\u2019s do what our parents told us before we probably even got that first credit card. Don\u2019t live outside of our means. We need to make sure that as individuals we\u2019re taking personal responsibility through all of this.

John McCain while Barack Obama was warning about what we had to do was literally giving an interview to \u201cThe Wall Street Journal\u201d saying that I\u2019m always for cutting regulations. We let Wall Street run wild. John McCain and he\u2019s a good man, but John McCain thought the answer is that tried and true Republican response, deregulate, deregulate."}

That\u2019s a smart thing to do. That\u2019s budget neutral. That doesn\u2019t cost the government anything as opposed to Barack Obama\u2019s plan to mandate health care coverage and have universal government run program and unless you\u2019re pleased with the way the federal government has been running anything lately, I don\u2019t think that it\u2019s going to be real pleasing for Americans to consider health care being taken over by the feds. But a $5,000 health care credit through our income tax that\u2019s budget neutral. That\u2019s going to help. And he also wants to erase those artificial lines between states so that through competition, we can cross state lines and if there\u2019s a better plan offered somewhere else, we would be able to purchase that.

But look, here\u2019s what the fundamental problem I have with John\u2019s policy about terror instability. John continues to tell us that the central war in the front on terror is in Iraq. I promise you, if an attack comes in the homeland, it\u2019s going to come as our security services have said, it is going to come from al Qaeda planning in the hills of Afghanistan and Pakistan. That\u2019s where they live. That\u2019s where they are. That\u2019s where it will come from. And right now that resides in Pakistan. A stable government needs to be established. We need to support that democracy by helping them not only with their military but with their governance and their economic well-being."}
