On behalf of the Commission on Presidential Debates I am pleased to welcome you to this first presidential debate of the 1988 campaign. I\u2019m Jim Lehrer of the McNeil-Lehrer News Hour. My colleagues on the panel are John Mashek of The Atlanta Journal-Constitution; Ann Groer of The Orlando Sentinel; and Peter Jennings of ABC News. For the next 90 minutes we will be questioning the candidates for president of the United States following a format designed and agreed to by representatives of the two candidates. The candidates are Vice President George Bush, the Republican nominee; Governor Michael Dukakis, the Democratic nominee."}

The first question by agreement between the two candidates goes to Vice President Bush. It is a domestic question. You have two minutes for an answer, sir. The polls say the number one domestic issue to a majority of voters is drugs. What is there about these times that drives or draws so many Americans to use drugs?"}
{"Title":"September 25, 1988 Debate Transcript","Debate":"The First Bush-Dukakis Presidential Debate","Date":"September 25, 1988","Participants":"Bush-Dukakis","Moderators":"LEHRER","Speaker":"BUSH","Text":"I think we\u2019ve seen a deterioration of values. I think for a while as a nation we condoned those things we should have condemned. For a while, as I recall, it even seems to me that there was talk of legalizing or decriminalizing marijuana and other drugs, and I think that\u2019s all wrong. So we\u2019ve seen a deterioration in values, and one of the things that I think we should do about it in terms of cause is to instill values into the young people in our schools. We got away, we got into this feeling that value- free education was the thing. And I don\u2019t believe that at all I do believe there are fundamental rights and wrongs as far as use. And, of course, as far as the how we make it better, yes, we can do better on interdiction. But we\u2019ve got to do a lot better on education, and we have to do, be tougher on those who commit crimes. We\u2019ve got to get after the users more. We have to change this whole culture. You know, I saw a movie \u2013 \u201cCrocodile Dundee.\u201d And I saw the cocaine scene treated with humor, as though this was a humorous little incident. And it\u2019s bad. Everybody ought to be in this thing. Entertainment industry, people involved in the schools, education. And it isn\u2019t a Republican or a Democrat or a liberal problem. But we have got to instill values in these young people. And I have put forward a many-point drug program that includes what I would do as president of the United States; in terms of doing better on interdiction; and in terms of better in the neighborhoods. But I think we\u2019re all in this together, and my plea to the American people is values in the schools."}

And in my state I\u2019m proud to say we\u2019ve organized a drug education and prevention program which the Federal Drug Enforcement Administration says is a model for the country. We\u2019re helping youngsters; we\u2019re reaching out to them. And we\u2019re beginning with drug education and prevention beginning in the early elementary grades in every elementary school in our state, and that\u2019s the kind of effort we need in every elementary school in the United States of America. And we\u2019ve got to begin early, in the first, second and third grade, before our youngsters begin to experiment with these very, very dangerous substances. I guess the question I would ask of Mr. Bush is how we instill those values, how we create this environment for the drug free schools that we want in this country. If he or representatives of the administration are either with or involving people like Noriega in our foreign policy, or don\u2019t pursue that connection in a way that makes it possible for us to cut it off and to be an example to our kids all over the country."}

I asked for and received the same briefing. I am very careful in public life about dealing with classified information. And what I\u2019m about to say is unclassified. Seven administrations were dealing with Mr. Noriega. It was the Reagan-Bush administration that brought this man to justice. And as the governor of Massachusetts knows, there was no evidence that governor \u2013 that Mr. Noriega was involved in drugs, no hard evidence until we indicted him. And so I think it\u2019s about time we get this Noriega matter in perspective. Panama is a friendly country. I went down there and talked to the president of Panama about cleaning up their money laundering, and Mr. Noriega was there, but there was no evidence at that time, and when the evidence was there, we indicted him. And we want to bring him to justice. And so call off all those pickets out there that are trying to tear down seven different administrations."}

In a Dukakis administration, you say taxes will be raised only as a last resort. Would you identify for us then please three specific programs that you are willing to cut to bring that deficit down?"}
{"Title":"September 25, 1988 Debate Transcript","Debate":"The First Bush-Dukakis Presidential Debate","Date":"September 25, 1988","Participants":"Bush-Dukakis","Moderators":"LEHRER","Speaker":"DUKAKIS","Text":"Yes, I\u2019ve been very specific about those, John. And let me lay out for you my own strategy for bring that deficit down, because as a chief executive that\u2019s balanced ten budgets in a row, I\u2019ve had to make those tough decisions and those tough choices. First, I\u2019ve suggested that there are certain weapons systems which we don\u2019t need and we can\u2019t afford. Mr. Bush has been critical of me for that, but I think those are the kinds of tough choices you have to make. I\u2019ve also suggested that there are weapons systems that we should proceed on, and I\u2019ve outlined those in detail. Secondly, we\u2019ve got to invest in economic growth in this country, in every part of this country. Building that kind of growth expands revenues and helps to bring down that deficit. Thirdly, we have to bring interest rates down, and we will as we come up with a good, solid plan with the Congress for bringing that deficit down. And, finally, we\u2019ve got to go out there and collect billions and billions of dollars in taxes owed that aren\u2019t being paid to this country. It\u2019s very unfair to the average taxpayer who pays his taxes and pays them on time to permit these monies to go uncollected. I\u2019ve also suggested that on the domestic side there are areas where we can make some cuts. We ought to be able to come up with an agricultural policy in this country that gives our farm families a fair price and a decent future without spending $20-25 billion a year, which is what we\u2019ve been doing under this administration. We can help people to live better lives, and at the same time save money by helping hundreds of thousands of families on welfare to get off or welfare, and to become productive citizens again. The thing I don\u2019t understand about Mr. Bush\u2019s approach to this is how he could possibly be serious about bringing that deficit down given what he says he wants to do. He seems to want to spend a great deal of money on just about every weapon system; he says he\u2019s against new taxes, although he\u2019s broken that pledge at least times in the last year that I know of; he wants to give the wealthiest taxpayers in this country a five year, $40 billion tax break. He also wants to spend a lot of money on additional programs. If he keeps this up, he\u2019s going to be the Joe Isuzu of American politics."}

There are so many things there, I don\u2019t quite know where to begin. When you cut capital gains, you put people to work. John Kennedy proposed cutting capital gains. Paul Tsongas, a liberal senator from Massachusetts said the dumbest thing I did was to oppose the capital gains cut. It\u2019s not going to cost the government money. It\u2019s going to increase revenues to the federal government, and it\u2019s going to create jobs. So that\u2019s one of the things that I think makes a big difference between us. Massachusetts doesn\u2019t have an enormous defense budget, but nevertheless, the governor raised taxes five different times. That happens to be a fact. And so let\u2019s kind of stay on the issue, and I have made a specific proposal for what I call a flexible freeze. And it permits \u2013 economists on the East Coast and West think it\u2019s good \u2013 it permits the president to sort out the priorities, and we continue to grow because I will not raise taxes."}

You\u2019ve suggested new spending programs and even some Republicans say the flexible freeze you just spoke about will hardly make a dent in the deficit. Is the deficit no longer really a concern of yours, the Republican Party or the taxpayers?"}
{"Title":"September 25, 1988 Debate Transcript","Debate":"The First Bush-Dukakis Presidential Debate","Date":"September 25, 1988","Participants":"Bush-Dukakis","Moderators":"LEHRER","Speaker":"BUSH","Text":"I think it\u2019s the Republican Party and my concern to bring it down. And presidential leadership that I want to provide in this area will bring it down, but we\u2019ve got to get the Democrats \u2013 Congress under control. They do all the spending, they appropriate every dime and tell us how to spend every dime. I\u2019d like to ask the Governor to join in getting for the president what 43 governors have, the line-item veto. He has to operate in Massachusetts under a balanced budget proviso. I would like a balanced budget amendment. But the dynamics of the economy \u2013 we cut the taxes and revenues are up by 25 percent in three years. So the problem is \u2013 it\u2019s not that the working is being taxed too little or the person working out \u2013 the woman working in some factory being taxed too little. It is that we are continuing to spend too much. So, my formula says grow at the rate of inflation. Permit the president to set the priorities on where we do the spending. And remember the Federal deficit has come down $70 billion in one year, in 1987. And if we \u2013 and the \u2013 actually this year Congress is doing a little better in controlling the growth of spending. Spending was only up something like 4 percent. So, it isn\u2019t that we\u2019re taking too little \u2013 from taxpayer \u2013 we\u2019re spending too much still. And the formula I\u2019ve given you works, we\u2019ve put it through a good economic model, we\u2019ve got good economists on the West Coast, Michael Boskin and Marty Feldstein up there who\u2019s a very respected economist in the \u2013 Massachusetts. And they agree, that if we can do what I\u2019ve said, we can get it down without going and socking the American taxpayer once again. Capital gains, one more point on that, please let\u2019s learn from history. A capital gains differential will increase jobs, increase risk taking, increase revenues to the Federal Government."}

What he\u2019s proposing after over a trillion in new debt which has been added in the Federal debt in the course of the past eight years, an IOU our children and grandchildren will be paying for years, is a tax cut for the wealthiest one percent of the people in this country, an average of about $30,000 that we\u2019re going to give to people making $200,000 a year. Why that\u2019s more than the average teacher makes. We\u2019ve had enough of that, ladies and gentlemen. We\u2019ve run up more debt in the last eight years than under all the presidents from George Washington to Jimmy Carter combined.

Today, 37 million Americans including many working families with aging parents and young children cannot afford any health insurance, but earn too much to qualify for Medicaid. What will you do to provide protection for them and how will you pay for it?"}
{"Title":"September 25, 1988 Debate Transcript","Debate":"The First Bush-Dukakis Presidential Debate","Date":"September 25, 1988","Participants":"Bush-Dukakis","Moderators":"LEHRER","Speaker":"BUSH","Text":"One thing I will not do is sock every business in the country and, thus, throw some people out of work. I want to keep this economic recovery going. More Americans at work today than any time in history, a greater percentage of the work force. What I will do is permit people to buy into Medicaid. I believe that\u2019s the answer. I am proud to have been part of an administration that past the first catastrophic health bill. And in that there are some Medicaid provisions that will be very helpful to the very kind of people we\u2019re talking about here. But we\u2019ve got to keep going forward without killing off the engine and throwing people out of work. So, the answer lies, it seems to me, in full enforcement of the catastrophic program. It lies to me in flexibility in Medicaid so people at the lowest end can buy in there and get their needs covered and then it also \u2013 I do not want to see us mandate across the board that every company has to do this, because I really think that marginal operators are going to go say, \u201cWe can\u2019t make it.\u201d And I think then you\u2019re going to see that people are put out of work. All these programs \u2013 and this cost on his \u2013 is \u2013 was \u2013 I saw an estimate, I\u2019d love to know what he thinks, $35 \u2013 $40 billion \u2013 and it seems to me that somebody pays that. There isn\u2019t any such thing as something free out there. It either gets passed along as increased prices or it gets passed along by people being put out of work so the business can continue to compete. So, I think we ought to do it in the Medicaid system. I think we ought to do it by full enforcement of the catastrophic health insurance. I think we ought to do it by everybody doing what they can do out of conscience. It\u2019s a terrible problems in terms of flexibility on private insurance. But I just don\u2019t want to mandate it and risk putting this \u2013 setting the recovery back."}

I was in Houston on Tuesday meeting with a group of good citizens, working citizens. All of them with little or no health insurance. One of them was a father who had been laid off a few months ago and lost his health insurance. Has an 11 year old son and can\u2019t let that son compete in sports and Little League, because he\u2019s afraid he\u2019s going to get hurt and he won\u2019t be able to provide health insurance to pay those bills. My state just became the only state in the nation to provide for universal health care and we did it with the support of the business community and labor and the health care community and with virtually everybody in the state. The fact of the matter is that employers who today are insuring their employees are paying the freight, because they\u2019re paying for those who aren\u2019t. And I think it\u2019s time that when you got a job in this country it came with health insurance. That\u2019s the way we\u2019re going to provide basic health security for all of the citizens of this country of ours."}

Since your Massachusetts health plan has been attacked by the Vice President and you have defended it in this way, I would like to move on to perhaps one of the most costly medical catastrophes facing Americans today and that is AIDS. In \u2013 at the end of September, the thousands of AIDS patients will lose their access to AZT, which is the only Federally approved drug for treatment of the disease. Now, I\u2019d like to now, sir, if \u2013 what your position is on extending that and what it is you think the government ought to be doing about making AZT and other drugs available to people who are suffering from this disease."}

But when I proposed my plan this past Tuesday, he or one of his spokesmen called it socialized medicine. The last time the Vice President used that phrase, I suspect he remembers it, don\u2019t you? It was in 1964 and that\u2019s what he called Medicare. Well, he was wrong then and he\u2019s wrong now. (Applause)"}

It\u2019s the single most important public health crisis, single most important public health emergency we\u2019ve had in our lifetimes and I think there are a number of things we have to do including supporting legislation which is now moving through the Congress, which will commit this nation to the resources to find a cure which will provide broad education and prevention, which will provide sensitive and caring treatment for the victims of AIDS. I think we have to demonstrate some flexibility and I think the FDA is attempting to do so now in trying to make it possible for new and experimental drugs to be available to people who are at risk at AIDS and I would hope that we could bring that kind of a policy to bear beginning in January. And I would encourage the current administration to proceed with that kind of flexibility where it\u2019s appropriate and where it\u2019s done carefully and responsibly. But we have not had the kind of leadership we should have had. In this particular area, I think the Vice President and I are in general agreement on what we have to do. The special Federal commission made good solid recommendations. I think we\u2019re both supportive of them and I would strongly lead in that area as I have in my state as Governor."}

I\u2019m Chairman of the President\u2019s Task Force on Regulatory Relief and we are working with the FDA and they have sped up bringing drugs to market that can help.

But, Peter, please understand, the liberals do not like me talking about liberal They don\u2019t like it when I say that he says he\u2019s a card carrying member. Now, if that quote was wrong, he can repudiate it, right here. I\u2019ve seen it authoritatively written twice, and if I\u2019ve done him an injustice, and he didn\u2019t say it, I\u2019m very, very sorry. But I don\u2019t agree with a lot of \u2013 most of the positions of the ACLU. I simply don\u2019t want to see the ratings on movies. I don\u2019t want my ten year old grandchild to go into an X-rated movie. I like those ratings systems. I don\u2019t think they\u2019re right to try to take the tax exemption away from the Catholic Church. I don\u2019t want to see the kiddie pornographic laws repealed; I don\u2019t want to see \u201cunder God\u201d come out from our currency. Now, these are all positions of the ACLU. And I don\u2019t agree with them. He has every right to exercise his passion, as what he said, a strong, progressive liberal. I don\u2019t agree with that. I come from a different point. And I think I\u2019m more in touch with the mainstream of America. They raised the same thing with me on the Pledge of Allegiance. You see, I\u2019d have found a way to sign that bill. Governor Thompson of Illinois did. I\u2019m not questioning his patriotism. He goes out and says the man is questioning my patriotism. And then all the liberal columnists join in. I am not. I am questioning his judgment on these matters, or where he\u2019s coming from He has every right to do it. But I believe that\u2019s not what the American people want, and when he said, when he said at the convention, ideology doesn\u2019t matter, just competence, he was moving away from his own record, from what his passion has been over the years. And that\u2019s all I\u2019m trying to do, is put it in focus.

What commitment are you willing to make tonight to this voiceless segment of our society?"}
{"Title":"September 25, 1988 Debate Transcript","Debate":"The First Bush-Dukakis Presidential Debate","Date":"September 25, 1988","Participants":"Bush-Dukakis","Moderators":"LEHRER","Speaker":"BUSH","Text":"I want to see the McKinney Act fully funded. I believe that that would help in terms of shelter. I want to see \u2013 when I talked at our convention about a thousand points of light, I was talking about the enormous numbers of shelters and organizations that help. The governor\u2019s wife has been very active in the homeless. My campaign chairman, Secretary Jim Baker\u2019s wife. This isn\u2019t government. These are people that care, that are trying to give of themselves. The government has a role. It is to fully fund the McKinney Act. There are certain army bases that the act calls for that can be used in certain cases to shelter people when it\u2019s rough. And so I think that we\u2019re on the right track. I don\u2019t see this, incidentally, as a Democrat or a Republican or a liberal or conservative idea. I see an involvement by a thousand points of light. I see the funding that is required, and I hope the Congress will fully fund this bill. They gave it a great deal of conscience and a great deal of work. And we\u2019re on the track on this one. But \u2013 and I, look, mental \u2013 that was a little overstated it. I\u2019d say around 30 percent. And I think maybe we could look back over our shoulders and wonder whether it was right to let all those mental patients out. Maybe we need to do a better job in mental clinics to help them. Because there is a major problem there. A lot of them are mentally sick. And we\u2019ve got to attend to them. But fully, my short range answer is fully fund that McKinney Act."}

The problem, Mr. Bush, is that you\u2019ve cut back by 90 percent on our commitment to affordable housing for families of low and moderate income. And when you do that, you\u2019ve have homeless families. We didn\u2019t have two and a half million, or three million homeless people living on streets and in doorways in this country ten years ago. We\u2019ve got to begin to get back to the business of building and rehabilitating housing for families of low and moderate income in this country; housing for young families that they can look forward some day to buy. We\u2019ve got communities in this country increasingly where our own kids can\u2019t afford to live in the communities that they grew up in. That\u2019s an essential commitment. And I think the housing community is ready. But it\u2019s going to take a president who\u2019s committed to housing, who\u2019s had experience in building and rehabilitating housing who understands that affordable housing for families of low and moderate income, for young families, first time home buyers, is an essential part of the American dream. And while I\u2019m all for the McKinney bill, that, by itself, simply won\u2019t do. We\u2019ve got to have a president that can lead on this issue, that can work with the Congress, and I\u2019m prepared to do so.

And yet in spite of your answer just a few minutes ago, what promise can you realistically hold out to these people that with the costs of housing going up, and with limited help available from Washington, are we destined to become a nation of renters?"}
{"Title":"September 25, 1988 Debate Transcript","Debate":"The First Bush-Dukakis Presidential Debate","Date":"September 25, 1988","Participants":"Bush-Dukakis","Moderators":"LEHRER","Speaker":"DUKAKIS","Text":"Well, I certainly hope not. And it\u2019s all a question of what our priorities are. Mr. Bush talked about values. I agree with him. What are our values? Isn\u2019t providing housing for families of low and moderate income, isn\u2019t it making possible for young families, first time home buyers to own their own home some day something that\u2019s part of the American dream? I think so. You know, back after World War II when we had hundreds of thousands of GIs who came back from the war, we didn\u2019t sit around. We went out and built housing. The government was very much involved; so was the housing industry; so was the banking industry; so were housing advocates; so were non-profit agencies; so were governors and mayors and people all over this country who believe deeply in home ownership and affordable housing. Now, that\u2019s the kind of leadership that I want to provide as president of the United States. This isn\u2019t a question of a little charity for the homeless. This is a question of organizing the housing community. I\u2019ve talked to bankers and builders and developers, the housing advocates, community development agencies, and they want leadership from Washington. Washington, by itself, can\u2019t do it all. We shouldn\u2019t expect that. But governors are ready; mayors are ready. Builders and community leaders are ready. It will require some funds, John. And we ought to be prepared to provide those funds. But that, too, will require some choices. Mr. Bush wants to spend billions and trillions on Star Wars. Well, that\u2019s a choice we have to make, isn\u2019t it? Do we spend money on that weapon system in the billions and trillions, or is providing some decent and affordable housing for families of this country something that is at least as important and probably more so. Because it\u2019s so essential to our economic strength and to our future. Now, that\u2019s the kind of presidency I believe in. And simply to say, well, the McKinney bill will do it just doesn\u2019t do. We need a president who will lead on this issue, who has had experience on this issue. It\u2019s the kind of priority that will be at the top of our list beginning in January of 1989."}

But we\u2019re not going to do it in that old Democratic, liberal way of trying to build more bricks and mortars. Go out and take a look at St. Louis at some of that effort. It is wrong. I favor home ownership. I want to see more vouchers. I want to see control of some of these projects, and I want to keep the interest rates down. They\u2019re half, now of what they were when we came into office, and with my policy of getting this deficit under control, they\u2019ll be a lot less. But if we spend and spend and spend, that is going to wrap up the housing market, and we\u2019ll go right back to the days of the misery index and malaise that President Reagan and I have overcome \u2013 thank God for the United States on that one."}

I\u2019m also very tough on violent crime. And that\u2019s one of the reasons why my state has cut crime by more than any other industrial state in America. It\u2019s one of the reasons why we have the lowest murder rate of any industrial state in the country. It\u2019s one of the reasons why we have a drug education and prevention program that is reaching out and helping youngsters all over our state, the kind of thing I want to do as president of the United States. You know, the vice president says he wants to impose the death penalty on drug traffickers, and yet his administration has a federal furlough program which is one of the most permissive in the country, which gave last year 7,000 furloughs to drug traffickers and drug pushers, the same people that he says he now wants to execute. The issue of abortion is a very difficult issue, one that I think that we all have to wrestle with, we have to come to terms with. I don\u2019t favor abortion. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a good thing. I don\u2019t think most people do. The question is who makes the decision.

And I favor the death penalty. I know it\u2019s tough and honest people can disagree. But when a narcotics wrapped up guy goes in and murders a police officer, I think they ought to pay with their life. And I do believe it would be inhibiting. And so I am not going to furlough men like Willie Horton, and I would meet with their, the victims of his last escapade, the rape and the brutalization of the family down there in Maryland. Maryland would not extradite Willie Horton, the man who was furloughed, the murderer, because they didn\u2019t want him to be furloughed again. And so we have a fundamental difference on this one.

And you see, yes, my position has evolved. And it\u2019s continuing to evolve, and it\u2019s evolving in favor of life. And I have had a couple of exceptions that I support \u2013 rape, incest and the life of the mother. Sometimes people feel a little uncomfortable talking about this, but it\u2019s much clearer for me now. As I\u2019ve seen abortions sometimes used as a birth control device, for heavens sakes. See the millions of these killings accumulate, and this is one where you can have an honest difference of opinion. We certainly do. But no, I\u2019m for the sanctity of life, and once that illegality is established, then we can come to grips with the penalty side, and of course there\u2019s got to be some penalties to enforce the law, whatever they may be."}

{"Title":"September 25, 1988 Debate Transcript","Debate":"The First Bush-Dukakis Presidential Debate","Date":"September 25, 1988","Participants":"Bush-Dukakis","Moderators":"LEHRER","Speaker":"JENNINGS","Text":"Mr. Vice President, I\u2019m struck by your discussion of women and the sanctity of life. And it leads me to recall your own phrase, that you are haunted by the lives which children in our inner cities live. Certainly the evidence is compelling. There\u2019s an explosion of single parent families. And by any measure, these single parent families, many with unwanted children, are the source of poverty, school drop outs, crime, which many people in the inner city simply feel is out of control. If it haunts you so, why over the eight years of the Reagan-Bush administration have so many programs designed to help the inner cities been eliminated or cut?"}
{"Title":"September 25, 1988 Debate Transcript","Debate":"The First Bush-Dukakis Presidential Debate","Date":"September 25, 1988","Participants":"Bush-Dukakis","Moderators":"LEHRER","Speaker":"BUSH","Text":"One of the reasons, and I first would like to know which programs you\u2019re talking about, and then we could talk on the merits of the programs. But, you see, my fundamental philosophy is give local and state government as much control as possible. That might be the explanation, if you tell me the program. I do strongly support the WIC program. I think it is good. I think part of the answer to this haunting of these children that are out there and suffering lies in extension of Medicaid, to challenge the states, and maybe we\u2019re going to have to enforce more on the states in terms of Medicaid taking care of these. But, Peter, so much of it is, gets into a whole other phase of things. The neighborhood, the kind of environment people are growing up in, and that leads me to the programs I\u2019m talking about in terms of education. I think that part of it is the crime infested neighborhoods, and that\u2019s why I\u2019m a strong believer in trying to control crimes in the neighborhood, why I was so pleased to be endorsed by the policemen on the beat, the Boston Police Department the other day. I think they understand my commitment to helping them in the neighborhoods. And so it\u2019s a combination of these things. But do not erode out of the system the thousand points of light. The people that are out there trying to help these kids, the programs like cities and schools, the work that Barbara Bush is doing so people can learn to read in this country and then go on and break this cycle of poverty. I\u2019m for Head Start and moving that up. And I\u2019ve already made a proposal \u2013 and yes, it will cost some money. But I favor that. So these are the combination of things I want, and the fact that I don\u2019t think the federal government can endorse a $35 billion program does not mean I have less compassion than the person who endorses such a program."}

It\u2019s cut federal aid to education; it\u2019s cut Pell grants and loans to close the door to college opportunity on youngsters all over this country. And that, too, is a major difference between the vice president and me. Let me just give you one other example. We have a great many people, hundreds of thousands of people living on public assistance in this country. The 50 governors of this nation have proposed to the Congress that we help those families to get off of welfare, help those youngsters, help their mothers to become independent and self-sufficient. It\u2019s taken months and months and months to get Mr. Bush and the administration to support that legislation, and they\u2019re still resisting. That\u2019s the way you help people. Being haunted, a thousand points of light \u2013 I don\u2019t know what that means. I know what strong political leadership is. I know what\u2019s happened over the course of the past eight years.

Welfare reform is one way to do it. If we invest in job training, in child care for those youngsters, in some extended health benefits so that that mother and her kids don\u2019t lose their health benefits when she goes to work, we can help literally hundreds of thousands, if not millions of families, to get off of welfare, to become independent and self-sufficient, to be taxpaying citizens, and to improve their lives, the quality of lives, their futures, and the futures of those children."}

In my own state, for example, we now have that universal health care system, which the vice president opposes, I think very unwisely. One of the greatest barriers to opportunity for a family and for those children is the threat that they mat lose their health insurance. Think about that father down there in Houston who has to tell his youngster that he can\u2019t play little league ball that he can\u2019t go out on the ball field because he\u2019s afraid he\u2019s going to get hurt."}

Be cautious. Because the Soviet change is not fully established yet. Yes, I think it\u2019s fine to do business with them. And, so, I\u2019m encouraged with what I see when I talk to Mr. \u2014 what I hear when I talk to Mr. Gorbachev and Mr. Shevardnadze, but can they pull it off."}

And I\u2019d like each person to say did I jump to conclusions running down rumors that were so outrageous and so brutal. And he\u2019s kept his head up. And he will do very very well. And he has my full confidence and he\u2019ll have the confidence of people that are in their 30\u00cf\u20acs and 40\u00cf\u20acs and more. So, judge the man on his record not on the-lot of rumors and innuendo and trying to fool around with his name."}

Bio-degradable plastics-plastic-gasohol, which the Vice President has been involved in, road de-icers made from corn products.
