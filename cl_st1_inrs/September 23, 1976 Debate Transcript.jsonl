I\u2019m Edwin Newman, moderator of this first debate of the 1976 campaign between Gerald R. Ford of Michigan, Republican candidate for president, and Jimmy Carter of Georgia, Democratic candidate for president. We thank you, President Ford and we thank you, Governor Carter, for being with us tonight. There are to be three debates between the presidential candidates and one between the vice-presidential candidates. All are being arranged by the League of Women Voters Education Fund. Tonight\u2019s debate, the first between presidential candidates in sixteen years and the first ever in which an incumbent president has participated, is taking place before an audience in the Walnut Street Theater in Philadelphia, just three blocks from Independence Hall. The television audience may reach a hundred million in the United States and many millions overseas. Tonight\u2019s debate focuses on domestic issues and economic policy. Questions will be put by Frank Reynolds of ABC News, James Gannon of the Wall Street Journal, and Elizabeth Drew of the New Yorker magazine. Under the agreed rules the first question will go to Governor Carter. That was decided by the toss of a coin. He will have up to three minutes to answer. One follow-up question will be permitted with up to two minutes to reply. President Ford will then have two minutes to respond. The next question will go to President Ford with the same time arrangements, and questions will continue to be alternated between the candidates. Each man will make a three-minute statement at the end, Governor Carter to go first. President Ford and Governor Carter do not have any notes or prepared remarks with them this evening. Mr. Reynolds, your question for Governor Carter."}

Governor, in an interview with the Associated Press last week, you said you believed these debates would alleviate a lot of concern that some voters have about you. Well, one of those concerns, not an uncommon one about uh \u2013 candidates in any year, is that many voters say they don\u2019t really know where you stand. Now, you have made jobs your number one priority and you have said you are committed to a drastic reduction in unemployment. Can you say now, Governor, in specific terms, what your first step would be next January, if you are elected, to achieve that."}
{"Title":"September 23, 1976 Debate Transcript","Debate":"The First Carter-Ford Presidential Debate","Date":"September 23, 1976","Participants":"Carter-Ford","Moderators":"EDWIN NEWMAN","Speaker":"MR. CARTER","Text":"Yes. First of all is to recognize a tremendous economic strength in this country and to set the putting to \u2013 back to work of our people as a top priority. This is uh \u2013 an effort that ought to be done primarily by strong leadership in the White House, the inspiration of our people, the tapping of uh \u2013 business, agriculture, industry, labor and government at all levels to work on this uh project. We\u2019ll never have uh \u2013 an end to the inflationary spiral, and we\u2019ll never have a balanced budget until we get our people back to work. There are several things that can be done specifically that are not now being done. First of all, to channel research and development funds into areas that will provide uh large numbers of jobs. Secondly, we need to have a commitment in the uh private sector uh \u2013 to cooperate with government in matters like housing. Here a very small investment of taxpayer\u2019s money \u2013 in the housing field can bring large numbers of extra jobs, and the guarantee of mortgage loans, and the uh \u2013 putting forward of uh \u2013 two-0-two programs for housing for older people and so forth to cut down the roughly 20 percent unemployment that now exists in the \u2013 in the construction industry. Another thing is to deal with our \u2013 uh needs in the central cities, where the unemployment rate is extremely high: sometimes among minority groups, or those who don\u2019t speak English, or who\u2019re black, or young people, or \u2013 40 percent of the employment. Here a CCC type program would be appropriate to channel money into the ah \u2013 cha- in \u2013 in into the sharing with the private sector and also local and state governments to employ young people who are now out of work. Another very important \u2013 uh aspect of our \u2013 uh economy would be to increase production in every way possible, uh to hold down \u2013 uh taxes on individuals, and to uh shift the tax burdens onto those who have avoided paying taxes in the past. These uh \u2013 kinds of specific things, uh none of which are being done now, would be a great help in \u2013 in reducing uh unemployment. There is uh \u2013 uh an additional factor that needs to be done and covered very \u2013 very succinctly, and that is, to make sure that we have a good relationship between management \u2013 business on the one hand, and labor, on the other. In a > Transfer interrupted! ery high, we might channel specific uh targeted job \u2013 job \u2013 uh opportunities by paying part of the salary of unemployed people \u2013 uh and also sharing with uh \u2013 local governments the uh \u2013 payment of salaries which would uh \u2013 let us cut down the unemployment rate much lower, before we hit the inflationary level. But I believe that by the end of the first four years of uh \u2013 of the next term we could have the unemployment down to 3 percent adult unemployment, which is about uh \u2013 4 to 4 and a half percent overall uh controlled inflation rate and have a uh balance of growth of about \u2013 uh 4 to 6 percent, around 5 percent which would give us a balanced budget."}

And I think this would uh \u2013 this would be uh easy to accomplish, to get jobs down, without having strong in- inflationary pressures that \u2013 that would be necessary. I would not favor the uh \u2013 payment of uh \u2013 of a given fixed income to people unless they are not able to work. But with tax incentives for the low-income groups we could build up their uh \u2013 income levels uh \u2013 above the poverty level and not uh make welfare more uh \u2013 profitable than \u2013 than work."}

FORD","Text":"I don\u2019t believe that uh that Mr. Carter\u2019s been any more specific in this case than he has been on many other instances. I notice particularly that he didn\u2019t endorse the Humphrey-Hawkins bill which he has on occasions and which is included as a part of the Democratic platform. That legislation uh allegedly would help our unemployment, but uh \u2013 we all know that it would\u2019ve controlled our economy, it would\u2019ve added uh \u2013 ten to thirty billion dollars each year in additional expenditures by the Federal Government. It would\u2019ve called for export controls on agricultural products In my judgment the best way to get jobs is to uh \u2013 expand the private sector, where five out of six jobs today exist in our economy. We can do that by reducing Federal taxes as I proposed uh \u2013 about a year ago when I called for a tax reduction of $28 billion \u2013 three-quarters of it to go to private uh taxpayers and uh one-quarter to the business sector. We could add to jobs in the major metropolitan areas by a proposal that I recommended that would give tax incentives to business to move into the inner city and to expand or to build new plants so that they would take a plant, or expand a plant where people are, and people are currently unemployed. We could uh \u2013 also uh \u2013 help our youths with some of the proposals that uh \u2013 would give to young people an opportunity to work and learn at the same time just like we give money to young people who are going to college. Those are the kind of specifics that I think we have to discuss on these uh \u2013 debates, and these are the kind of programs that I\u2019ll talk about on my time."}

{"Title":"September 23, 1976 Debate Transcript","Debate":"The First Carter-Ford Presidential Debate","Date":"September 23, 1976","Participants":"Carter-Ford","Moderators":"EDWIN NEWMAN","Speaker":"MR. GANNON","Text":"Mr. President, I would like to continue for a moment on this uh question of taxes which you have just raised. You have said that you favor more tax cuts for middle-income Americans \u2013 even those earning up to $30 thousand a year. That presumably would cost the Treasury quite a bit of money in lost revenue. In view of the very large budget deficits that you have accumulated and that are still in prospect, how is it possible to promise further tax cuts and to reach your goal of balancing the budget?"}
{"Title":"September 23, 1976 Debate Transcript","Debate":"The First Carter-Ford Presidential Debate","Date":"September 23, 1976","Participants":"Carter-Ford","Moderators":"EDWIN NEWMAN","Speaker":"MR. FORD","Text":"At the time, Mr. Gannon, that I made the recommendation for a $28 billion tax cut \u2013 three-quarters of it to go to individual taxpayers and 25 percent to American business. I said at the time that we had to hold the lid an federal spending, that for every dollar of a tax reduction we had to have an equal reduction in federal expenditures \u2013 a one-for-one proposition. And I recommended that to the Congress with a budget ceiling of three hundred and ninety-five billion dollars, and that would have permitted us to have a $25 billion tax reduction. In my tax reduction program for middle-income taxpayers, I recommended that the Congress increase personal exemptions from seven hundred and fifty dollars per person to one thousand dollars per person. That would mean, of course, that for a family of four that that family would have a thousand dollars more personal exemption \u2013 money that they could spend for their own purposes, money that the government wouldn\u2019t have to spend. But if we keep the lid on federal spending, which I think we can \u2013 with the help of the Congress, we can justify fully a $28 billion tax reduction. In the budget that I submitted to the Congress in January this year, I re- recommended a 50 percent cutback in the rate of growth of federal spending. For the last ten years the budget of the United States has grown from uh \u2013 about 11 percent per year. We can\u2019t afford that kind of growth in federal spending. And in the budget that I recommended we cut it in half \u2013 a growth rate of 5 to 5 and one-half percent. With that kind of limitation, on federal spending, we can fully justify the tax reductions that I have proposed. And it seems to me with the stimulant of more money in the hands of the taxpayers, and with more money in the hands of business to expand, to modernize, to provide more jobs, our economy stimulated so that we\u2019ll get more revenue and we\u2019ll have a more prosperous economy."}

GANNON","Text":"Mr. President, to follow up a moment, uh \u2013 the Congress has passed a tax bill which is before you now, which did not meet exactly the uh \u2013 sort of outline that you requested. What is your intention on that bill, uh \u2013 since it doesn\u2019t meet your \u2013 your requirements? Do you plan to sign that bill?"}
{"Title":"September 23, 1976 Debate Transcript","Debate":"The First Carter-Ford Presidential Debate","Date":"September 23, 1976","Participants":"Carter-Ford","Moderators":"EDWIN NEWMAN","Speaker":"MR. FORD","Text":"That tax bill does not entirely meet the criteria that I established. I think the Congress should have uh \u2013 added another $10 billion reduction in personal income taxes, including the increase of personal exemptions from seven hundred and fifty to a thousand dollars. And Congress could have done that if the budget committees of the Congress, and the Congress as a whole, had not increased the spending that I recommended in the budget. I\u2019m sure that you know that in the resolutions passed by the Congress, that have added about $17 billion in more spending, by the Congress over the budget that I recommended. So I would prefer in that tax bill to have an additional tax cut and a further limitation on federal spending. Now this tax bill \u2013 that hasn\u2019t reached the White House yet, but is expected in a day or two \u2013 it\u2019s about fifteen hundred pages. It has some good provisions in it. It has \u2013 uh left out some that I have recommended, unfortunately. On the other hand, uh when you have a bill of that magnitude, with \u2013 tho- those many provisions, a president has to sit and decide if there\u2019s more good than bad. And from the a- analysis that I\u2019ve made so far, it seems to me that that tax bill does uh \u2013 justify my signature and my approval."}

{"Title":"September 23, 1976 Debate Transcript","Debate":"The First Carter-Ford Presidential Debate","Date":"September 23, 1976","Participants":"Carter-Ford","Moderators":"EDWIN NEWMAN","Speaker":"MR. CARTER","Text":"Well, Mr. Ford is \u2013 is uh changing uh considerably his previous philosophy. The present tax structure is a disgrace to this country; it\u2019s just a welfare program for the rich. As a matter of fact, uh \u2013 25 percent of the total tax deductions, go for only 1 percent of the richest people in this country, and over 50 percent of the tax uh credits go for the 14 percent of the richest people in this country. When Mr. Ford first became president in \u2013 in August of 1974, the first thing he did in \u2013 in October was to ask for a $4.7 billion increase in taxes on our people in the midst of the heaviest recession, since uh \u2013 since the great depression of nineteen uh \u2013 of the 1940s. In uh \u2013 January of 1975 he asked for a tax change: a $5.6 billion increase on low-and-middle-income private individuals, a six and a half billion dollar decrease on the corporations and the special interests. In uh \u2013 December of uh \u2013 1975 he vetoed the roughly 18 to 20 billion dollar uh tax-reduction bill that had been passed by the Congress, and then he came back later on in January of this year and he did advocate a $10 billion tax reduction, but it would be offset by a $6 billion increase this coming January in deductions for Social Security payments and for unemployment compensation. The whole philosophy of the Republican party, including uh \u2013 my opponent, has been to pile on taxes on low-income people to take \u2019em off on the corporations. As a matter fact, in \u2013 sin- since the late sixties when Mr. Nixon took office, we\u2019ve had a reduction in uh \u2013 in the percentage of taxes paid by corporations from 30 percent down to about 20 percent. We\u2019ve had an increase in taxes paid by individuals, payroll taxes, from14 Percent up to 20 percent. And this is what the Republicans have done to us. And this is why a tax reform is so important."}

Now you haven\u2019t put a price tag on those programs, but even if we price them conservatively and we count for full employment by the end of your first term, and we count for the economic growth that would occur during that period, there still isn\u2019t enough money to pay for those programs and balance the budget by any \u2013 any estimates that I\u2019ve been able to see.

If we assume the ah \u2013 uh \u2013 a rate of growth of our economy, equivalent to what it was during President Johnson, President Kennedy, even before the \u2013 the \u2013 the \u2013 uh wa uh \u2013 Vietnese- namese War, and if we assume that at the end of the four-year period we can cut our unemployment rate down to 4 to 4 and a half percent \u2013 under those circumstances, even assuming no elimination of unnecessary programs and assuming an increase in the ad- in the allotment of money to finance programs, increasing as the inflation rate does \u2013 my economic projections, I think confirmed by the House uh \u2013 and the Senate committees, have been with the $60 billion extra amount of money that can be spent in fiscal year \u201981 which will be the last year of this next term. Within that sixty-billion dollars increase there would be fit the programs that I promised the American people. I might say too, that \u2013 that if we see that these goals cannot be reached \u2013 and I believe they\u2019re reasonable goals \u2013 then I would cut back on the rate of implement- implementation of new programs in order to accommodate a balanced budget by fiscal year \u201981 which is the last year of the next term. I believe that we ought to have a balanced budget during normal economic circumstances. And uh \u2013 these projections have been very carefully made. I stand behind them. And if they should be in error slightly on the down side, then I\u2019ll phase in the programs that we\u2019ve uh \u2013 advocated, more slowly."}

Now this does not include uh \u2013 any uh \u2013 uh extra control over uh unnecessary spending, the weeding out of obsolete or obsolescent programs. Uh \u2013 we\u2019ll have uh \u2013 a safety version built in with complete reorganization of the executive branch of government which I am pledged to do. The present bureaucratic structure of the \u2013 of the Federal Government is a mess. And if I\u2019m elected president that\u2019s gonna be a top priority of mine to completely revise the structure of the federal government, to make it economical, efficient, purposeful and manageable for a change. And also, I\u2019m going to institute zero-based budgeting which I used four years in Georgia, which uh \u2013 assesses every program every year, and eliminates those programs that are obsolete or obsolescent. But with these projections, we will have a balanced budget by fiscal year 1981, if I\u2019m elected president. Keep my promises to the American people.

I feel that the taxpayers are the ones that need the relief: I don\u2019t think we should add additional programs of the magnitude that Governor Carter talks about. It seems to me that our tax structure today has rates that are too high. But I am uh \u2013 very glad to point out that since 1969, during a Republican administrations, we have had ten million people taken off of the tax rolls at the lower end of the taxpayer area. And at the same time, assuming that I sign the tax bill that was mentioned by Mr. Gannon, we will in the last two tax bills have increased the minimum tax on all wealthy taxpayers. And I believe that by eliminating ten million taxpayers in the last uh eight years, and by putting a heavier tax burden on those in the higher tax brackets, plus the other actions that\u2019ve been taken uh \u2013 we can give taxpayers adequate tax relief. Now it seems to me that uh \u2013 as we look at the recommendations of the budget committees and our own projections, there isn\u2019t going to be any $60 billion dividend. I\u2019ve heard of those dividends in the past; it always happens.

CARTER","Text":"Well I think it\u2019s uh\u2026 very difficult for President Ford to uh \u2013 explain the difference between the pardon of President Nixon and \u2013 and uh \u2013 his attitude toward those who violated the draft laws. As a matter of fact \u2013 now- I don\u2019t advocate amnesty; I advocate pardon. There\u2019s a difference in my opinion \u2013 uh and in accordance with the ruling of the Supreme Court and accordance with the definition in the dictionary. Amnesty means that \u2013 that you uh \u2013 that what you did was right. Pardon means that what you did, whether it\u2019s right or wrong, you\u2019re forgiven for it. And I do advocate a pardon for \u2013 for draft evaders. I think it\u2019s accurate to say that in uh \u2013 two years ago when Mr. Nixon \u2013 Mr. Ford put in this uh amnesty that three times as many deserters were uh \u2013 excused as were \u2013 as were the uh \u2013 the ones who evaded the draft. But I think that now is the time to heal our country after the Vietnam War and I think that what the people are concerned about is not the \u2013 uh pardon or the amnesty of uh \u2013 those who evaded the draft, but \u2013 but whether or not our crime system is \u2013 is fair. We\u2019ve got a \u2013 a sharp distinction drawn between white collar crime \u2013 the \u2013 the \u2013 the big shots who are rich, who are influential uh very seldom go to jail; those who are poor and \u2013 and who have uh no influence \u2013 uh quite often are the ones who are punished. And \u2013 and the whole uh subject of crime is one that concerns our people very much, and I believe that the fairness of it is \u2013 is what \u2013 uh \u2013 is a \u2013 is a major problem that addresses our \u2013 our leader and this is something that hasn\u2019t been addressed adequately by \u2013 by this administration. But I \u2013 I hope to have a complete uh responsibility on my shoulders to help bring about a \u2013 a fair uh \u2013 criminal justice system and also to \u2013 to bring about uh \u2013 an end to the \u2013 to the divise- divisiveness that has occurred in our country uh as a result of the Vietnam War."}

CARTER","Text":"Well, I\u2019ve been through this before, Mr. Gannon, as the governor of Georgia. When I took aver we had uh a bureaucratic mess, like we have in Washington now, and we had three hundred agencies, departments, bureaus, commissions \u2013 uh some uh \u2013 fully budgeted, some not, but all having responsibility to carry out that was in conflict. And we cut those three hundred \u2013 uh agencies and so forth down substantially. We eliminated two hundred and seventy-eight of them. We set up a simple structure of government that could be administrated fairly and it was a \u2013 a tremendous success. It hasn\u2019t been undone since I was there. It resulted also in an ability to reshape our court system, our prison system, our education system, our mental health programs and \u2013 and a clear assignment of responsibility and \u2013 and authority and also to have uh our people once again understanding control our government. I intend to do the same thing if I\u2019m elected president. When I get to Washington, coming in as an outsider, one of the major responsibilities that \u2013 that I will have on my shoulder is a complete reorganization of the \u2013 of the executive branch of government. We now have uh \u2013 a greatly expanded White House staff. When Mr. Nixon went in office, for instance, we had three and a half million dollars spent on \u2013 on the White House and its staff. That has escalated now to sixteen and a half million dollars, in the last uh Republican administration. This needs to be changed. We need to put the responsibilities back on the cabinet members. We also need to have a great reduction in agencies and programs. For instance, we now have uh \u2013 in the health area three hundred and two different programs administered by eleven major departments and agencies, sixty other advisory commissions responsible for this. Medicaid\u2019s in one agency; Medicare is in a different one. The \u2013 the check on the quality of health care is in a different one. None of them uh are responsible for health care itself. This makes it almost impossible for us to have a good health program. We have uh \u2013 just advocated uh \u2013 this past week a consolidation of the responsibilities for energy. Our country now has no comprehensive energy program or policy. We have twenty different agencies in the federal government responsible for the production, the regulation, the uh \u2013 information about energy, the conservation of energy, spread all over government. This is a \u2013 a gross waste of money, so tough, competent management of government, giving us a simple efficient purposeful and manageable government would be a great step forward and if I\u2019m elected \u2013 and I intend to be \u2013 then it\u2019s gonna be done."}

CARTER","Text":"I can\u2019t say for sure that we would have fewer federal employees when I go out of office than when I come in. It took me about three years to completely reorganize the Georgia government. The last year I was in office uh \u2013 our budget was \u2013 was actually less than it was a year before, uh which showed a great uh improvement. Also, we had a \u2013 a 2 percent increase in the number of employees the last year. But it was a tremendous shift from administrative jobs into the delivery of services. For instance, we uh \u2013 completely revised our prison system. We established eighty-four new mental health treatment centers. And we shifted people out of administrative jobs into the field to deliver better services. The same thing will be done uh \u2013 at the federal government level. I \u2013 I accomplished this with s \u2013 substantial reductions in employees in some departments. For instance, in the Transportation Department uh we had uh \u2013 we cut back about 25 percent of the total number of employees. In giving our people better mental health care, we increased the number of employees. But the efficiency of it, the simplicity of it, the uh ability of people to understand their own government and control it was a \u2013 was a uh \u2013 substantial benefit derived from complete reorganization. We uh \u2013 have got to do that at the federal government level. If we don\u2019t, the bureaucratic mess is going to continue. There\u2019s no way for our people now to understand what their government is. There\u2019s no way to get the answer to a question. When you come to Washington to try to \u2013 as a governor \u2013 to try to begin a new program for your people, like uh the treatment of drug addicts, I found there were thirteen different federal agencies that I had to go to, to manage the uh drug treatment program. In the Georgia government we only had one agency responsible for drug treatment. This is the kind of change that would be made. And uh \u2013 it would be of \u2013 of tremendous benefit in long-range planning, in tight budgeting, uh saving the taxpayers\u2019 money, making the government more efficient, cutting down on bureaucratic waste, having a clear delineation of authority and responsibility of employees, and giving our people a better chance to understand and control their government."}

And there was some very interesting testimony given by Governor Carter\u2019s successor, Governor Busby, before a Senate committee a few uh \u2013 months ago on how he found the Medicaid program when he came into office following Governor Carter. He testified, and these are his words \u2013 the present governor of Georgia \u2013 he says he found the Medicaid program in Georgia in shambles. Now let me talk about what we\u2019ve done in the White House as far as federal employees are concerned The first order that I issued after I became president was to cut or eliminate the prospective forty-thousand increase in federal employees that had been scheduled by my predecessor. And in the term that I\u2019ve been president \u2013 some two years \u2013 we have reduced federal employment by eleven thousand. In the White House staff itself, when I became president, we had roughly five hundred and forty employees. We now have about four hundred and eighty-five employees, so we\u2019ve made a rather significant reduction in the number of employees on the White House staff working for the president. So I think our record of cutting back employees, plus the failure on the part of the Governor\u2019s programs to actually save employment in Georgia, shows which is the better plan."}

FORD","Text":"Well, in the uh \u2013 last two years, as I indicated before, we had a very tough time. We were faced with uh \u2013 heavy inflation, over 12 percent; we were faced with substantial unemployment. But in the last uh \u2013 twenty-four months we\u2019ve turned the economy around and we\u2019ve brought inflation down to under 6 percent, and we have reduced the uh \u2013 well, we have added employment of about four million in the last seventeen months to the point where we have eighty-eight million people working in America today \u2013 the most in the history of the country. The net result is we are going to have some improvement in our receipts. And I think we\u2019ll have some decrease in our disbursements. We expect to have a lower deficit in fiscal year 1978. We feel that with this improvement in the economy; we feel with more receipts and fewer disbursements we can in a moderate way increase, as I recommended, over the next ten years a new parks program that would cast a billion and a half dollars, doubling our national park system. We have recommended that in the h- housing program we can reduce down payments and moderate monthly payments. But that doesn\u2019t cost any more as far as the federal treasury is concerned. We believe that we can uh do a better job in the area of crime, but that requires a tougher sentencing, mandatory certain prison sentences for those who violate our criminal laws. We \u2013 uh believe that uh you can revise the federal criminal code, which has not been revised in a good many years. That doesn\u2019t cost any more money. We believe that you can uhh \u2013 do something more effectively with a moderate increase in money in the drug abuse program. We feel that uh \u2013 in education we can have a slight increase \u2013 not a major increase. It\u2019s my understanding that Governor Carter has indicated that uh \u2013 he approves of a $30 billion uh \u2013 expenditure by the federal government as far as education is concerned. At the present time we\u2019re spending roughly three billion five hundred million dollars. I don\u2019t know where that money would come from. But as we look at the quality-of-life programs \u2013 jobs, health, education, crime, recreation \u2013 we feel that as we move forward with a healthier economy, we can absorb the small necessary cost that will be required."}

We won\u2019t wait one year or two years longer, as Governor Carter uh \u2013 indicates. As the economy improves, and it is improving, our gross national product this year will average about 6 percent increase over last year. We will have the lower rate of inflation for the uh \u2013 calendar year this year \u2013 something slightly under 6 percent. Employment will be up, revenues will be up. We\u2019ll keep the lid on some of these programs that we can hold down as we have a little extra money to spend for those quality-of-life programs which I think are needed and necessary. Now I cannot, and would not, endorse the kind of program that uh \u2013 Governor Carter recommends. He endorses the Democratic uh \u2013 platform which, as I read it, calls for approximately sixty additional programs. We estimate that those programs would add a hundred billion dollars minimum and probably two hundred billion dollars \u2013 uhh maximum each year to the federal budget.

In the last three months before an election, they\u2019re always for the programs that they always fight the other three-and-one-half years. Uh \u2013 I remember when uh \u2013 Herbert Hoover was against uh \u2013 jobs for people. I remember when Alf Landon was against Social Security and uh \u2013 later President Nixon, sixteen years ago, was telling the public that John Kennedy\u2019s proposals would bankrupt the country and would double the cost. The best thing to do is to look at the record uh \u2013 of Mr. Ford\u2019s Administration and Mr. Nixon\u2019s before his. Uh \u2013 we had last year a $65 billion deficit \u2013 the largest deficit in the history of our country \u2013 more of a deficit spending than we had in the entire eight-year period under President Johnson and President Kennedy. We\u2019ve got five hundred thousand more Americans out of jobs today than were out of work three months ago and since Mr. Ford\u2019s been in office two years, we\u2019ve had a 50 percent increase in unemployment from five million people out of work to two and a half million more people out of work and a total of seven and a half million. We\u2019ve also got uh \u2013 a comparison between himself and Mr. Nixon. He\u2019s got four times the size of the deficits that Mr. Nixon even had himself. This uh \u2013 talking about more people at work \u2013 uh is distorted because with a 14 percent increase in the cost of living in the last uh \u2013 two years, it means that \u2013 that women and young people have had to go to work when they didn\u2019t want to because their fathers didn\u2019t make enough to pay the increased cost of uh \u2013 food and uh housing and clothing. We have uh \u2013 in this last uh two years alone a hundred and twenty billion dollars total deficits under President Ford and uh \u2013 at the same time we\u2019ve had, in the last eight years, a doubling in the number of bankruptcies for small business: we\u2019ve had a negative growth in our \u2013 in our national economy measured in real dollars. The take-home pay of a worker in this country is actually less now than it was in 1968 \u2013 measured in real dollars. This is the kind of record that\u2019s there and talk about the future and a drastic change or conversion on the part of Mr. Ford as of last minute is one that just doesn\u2019t go."}

I think I know the \u2013 the uh capabilities and limitations of atomic power. But the energy \u2013 uh policy of our nation is one that uh has not yet been established under this administration. I think almost every other developed nation in the world has an energy policy except us. We have seen uh \u2013 the Federal Energy Agency established, for instance. Uh \u2013 in the crisis of 1973 it was supposed to be a temporary agency, uh now it\u2019s permanent, it\u2019s enormous, it\u2019s growing every day. I think the Wall Street Journal uh reported not too long ago they have a hundred and twelve public relations experts working for the Federal Energy Agency to try to justify to the American people its own existence. We\u2019ve got to have a \u2013 a firm way to handle the energy question. The reorganization proposal that I have put forward is one uh first step. In addition to that, we need to have \u2013 uh a realization that we\u2019ve got uh about thirty-five years worth of oil left in the whole world. We\u2019re gonna run out of oil. When Mr. Nixon made his famous uh speech on Operation Independence we were importing about 35 percent of our oil. Now we\u2019ve increased that amount 25 percent. We now import about 44 percent of our oil. We need to shift from oil to coal. We need to concentrate our research and development effort on uh coal burning and extraction, with safer mines, but also it\u2019s clean burning. We need to shift very strongly toward solar energy and have strict conservation measures. And then as a last resort only, continue to use atomic power. I would certainly uh \u2013 not cut out atomic power altogether. We can\u2019t afford to give up that opportunity until later. But to the extent that we continue to use atomic power, I would be responsible as president to make sure that the safety precautions were initiated and maintained. For instance, some that have been forgotten; we need to have the reactor core \u2013 below ground level, the entire power plant that uses atomic uh \u2013 power tightly sealed and a heavy \u2013 heavy vacuum maintained. There ought to be a standardized design. There ought to be a full-time uh \u2013 atomic energy specialist, independent of the power company in the control room, full time, twenty-four hours a day, to shut down a plant if an abnormality develops. These kinds of uh \u2013 procedures, along with evacuation procedures, adequate insurance, ought to be initiated. So, shift from oil to coal, emphasize research and development on coal use and also on solar power, strict conservation measures, not yield every time that the special interest groups uh \u2013 put pressure on the president like uh this administration has done, and use atomic energy only as a last resort with the strictest possible safety precautions. That\u2019s the best overall energy policy in the brief time we have to discuss it."}

And whenever the uh \u2013 automobile manufacturers come forward and say they can\u2019t meet the uh \u2013 amendments that the Congress has put forward, this Republican administration has delayed the implementation dates.

Why do you think it is better to pay out unemployment compensation to idle people than to put them to work in public service jobs?"}

FORD","Text":"The bills that I vetoed, the one for an additional $6 billion, was not a bill that would have solved our unemployment problems. Even the proponents of it admitted that no more than four hundred thousand jobs would be uh \u2013 made available. Our analysis indicates that something in the magnitude of about one hundred fifty to two hundred thousand jobs would uh \u2013 be made available. Each one of those jobs would\u2019ve cost the taxpayers $25 thousand. In addition, the jobs would not be available right now. They would not have materialized for about nine to eighteen months. The immediate problem we have is to stimulate our economy now so that we can get rid of unemployment. What we have done is to hold the lid on spending in an effort to reduce the rate of inflation. And we have proven, I think very conclusively, that you can reduce the rate of inflation and increase jobs. For example, as I have said, we have added some four million jobs in the last seventeen months. We have now employed eighty-eight million people in America, the largest number in the history of the United States. We\u2019ve added five hundred thousand jobs in the last two months. Inflation is the quickest way to destroy jobs. And by holding the lid on federal spending we have been able to do an- a good job, an affirmative job in inflation and as a result have added to the jobs in this country. I think it\u2019s uh \u2013 also appropriate to point out that through our tax policies we have stimulated uhh \u2013 added employment throughout the country, the investment tax credit, the tax incentives for expansion and modernization of our industrial capacity. It\u2019s my \u2013 my opinion that the private sector, where five out of six jobs are, where you have permanent jobs, with the opportunity for advancement, is a better place than make-work jobs under the program recommended by the Congress."}

I think it\u2019s interesting to point out that uh \u2013 in the uh \u2013 two years that I\u2019ve been president I\u2019ve vetoed fifty-six bills. Congress has sustained forty-two vetoes. As a result, we have saved over $9 billion in federal expenditures.

I was in uh \u2013 a city in uh \u2013 Pennsylvania not too long ago, near here, and uh \u2013 there were about four or five thousand people in the audience \u2013 it was on a \u2013 on a train trip. And I said, \u201cHow many uh \u2013 adults here are out of work?\u201d About a thousand raised their hands. Mr. Ford uh \u2013 actually has fewer people now in the private sector in non-farm jobs than when he took office. And still he talks about \u2013 uh success. Seven point nine percent unemployment is a terrible tragedy in this country. He says he\u2019s learned how to match unemployment with inflation. That\u2019s right. We\u2019ve got the highest inflation we\u2019ve had in twenty-five years right now, except under this administration, and that was fifty years ago. And we\u2019ve got uh \u2013 the highest unemployment we\u2019ve had uh \u2013 under Mr. Ford\u2019s administration, since the Great Depression. This affects human beings, and \u2013 and his insensitivity in providing those people a chance to work has made this a welfare administration, and not a work administration. He hasn\u2019t saved $9 billion with his vetoes. There\u2019s only been uh \u2013 a net savings of $4 billion. And the cost in unemployment compensation, welfare compensation, and lost revenues has increased $23 billion in the last two years. This is a \u2013 a typical attitude that really causes havoc in people\u2019s lives, and then it\u2019s covered over by saying that our country has naturally got a 6 percent unemployment rate, or 7 percent unemployment rate and a 6 percent inflation. It\u2019s a travesty. It shows a lack of leadership. And we\u2019ve never had a president since the War between the States that vetoed more bills. Mr. Ford has vetoed four times as many bills as Mr. Nixon \u2013 per year. And eleven of \u2019em have been overridden.

{"Title":"September 23, 1976 Debate Transcript","Debate":"The First Carter-Ford Presidential Debate","Date":"September 23, 1976","Participants":"Carter-Ford","Moderators":"EDWIN NEWMAN","Speaker":"MR. CARTER","Text":"Now we have uh such a grossly unbalanced tax system \u2013 as I said earlier, that it is a disgrace \u2013 ah of all the tax \u2013 benefits now, 25 percent of \u2019em go to the 1 percent of the richest people in this country. Over 50 percent \u2013 53 to be exact \u2013 percent of the tax benefits go to the 14 percent richest people in this country, and we\u2019ve had a 50 percent increase in payroll deductions since Mr. Nixon went in office eight years ago. Mr. Ford has \u2013 has advocated since he\u2019s been in office over $5 billion in reductions for corporations, special interest groups, and the very, very wealthy who derive their income \u2013 not from labor \u2013 but from investments. That\u2019s got to be changed. A few things that can be done: we have now a deferral system so that the multinational corporations who invest overseas \u2013 if they make a million dollars in profits overseas \u2013 they don\u2019t have to pay any of their taxes unless they bring their money back into this country. When they don\u2019t pay their taxes, the average American pays the taxes for them. Not only that, but it robs this country of jobs, because instead of coming back with that million dollars and creating a shoe factory, say in New Hampshire or Vermont, if the company takes the money down to Italy and \u2013 and builds a shoe factory, they don\u2019t have to pay any taxes on the money. Another thing is a system called DISC which was originally designed, proposed by Mr. Nixon, to encourage exports. This permits a company to create uh \u2013 a dummy corporation, to export their products, and then not to pay the full amount of taxes on them. This costs our uh \u2013 government about uh \u2013 $1.4 billion a year. And when those rich corporations don\u2019t pay that tax, the average American taxpayer pays it for \u2019em. Another one that\u2019s uh \u2013 that\u2019s very important is the uh \u2013 is the business deductions, uh \u2013 jet airplanes, uh \u2013 first class travel, the fifty-dollar martini lunch. The average working person can\u2019t \u2013 uh \u2013 can\u2019t take advantage of that, but the \u2013 the wealthier people \u2013 uh can. Uh \u2013 another system is where uhh \u2013 a dentist can invest money in say, raising cattle and uh \u2013 can put in a hundred thousand dollars of his own money, borrow nine hundred thousand dollars \u2013 nine hundred mi- thousand dollars \u2013 that makes a million \u2013 and mark off a great amount of uh \u2013 of loss uh \u2013 through that procedure. Uh \u2013 there was one example, for instance, where uh \u2013 somebody uh \u2013 produced pornographic movies. They put in $30 thousand of their own money and got a hundred and twenty thousand dollars in tax savings. Well, these special kinds of programs have \u2013 have robbed the average taxpayer and have benefited those who are powerful, and who can employ lobbyists, and who can have their CPAs and their lawyers to help them benefit from the roughly uh \u2013 eight thousand pages of the tax code. The average uh American person can\u2019t do it. You can\u2019t hire a lobbyist uh out of unemployment compensation checks."}

These programs that I described to you earlier \u2013 the tax deferrals for overseas, the DISC, and the tax shelters, uh \u2013 they only apply to people in the $50 thousand-a-year bracket or up, and I think this is the very best way to approach it.

In that interview uh \u2013 Governor Carter indicated that uh \u2013 he would raise the taxes on those in the medium or middle-income brackets or higher. Now if you uh \u2013 take the medium or middle-income taxpayer \u2013 that\u2019s about $14 thousand per person \u2013 uh \u2013 Governor Carter has indicated, publicly, in an interview that he would increase the taxes on about 50 percent of the working people of this country. I think uh \u2013 the way to get tax equity in this country is to give tax relief to the middle-income people who have an income from roughly $8 thousand up to twenty-five or thirty thousand dollars. They have been short-changed as we have taken ten million taxpayers off the tax rolls in the last eight years, and as we have uh \u2013 added to the minimum tax uh \u2013 provision to make all people pay more taxes. I believe in tax equity for the middle-income taxpayer, increasing the personal exemption. Mr. Carter wants to increase taxes for roughly half of the taxpayers of this country. Now, the Governor has also played a little fast and loose with the facts about vetoes. The records show that President Roosevelt vetoed an average of fifty-five bills a year. President Truman vetoed on the average, while he was president, about thirty-eight bills a year. I understand that Governor Carter, when he was Governor of Georgia, vetoed between thirty-five and forty bills a year. My average in two years is twenty-six. But in the process of that we have saved uhh \u2013 $9 billion. And one final comment, uh \u2013 Governor Carter talks about the tax bills and all of the inequities that exist in the present law. I must remind him the Democrats have controlled the Congress for the last twenty-two years and they wrote all the tax bills."}

The House Ethics Committee has just now ended its investigation of Daniel Schorr, after several months and many thousands of dollars, trying to find out how he obtained and caused to be published a report of the Congress that probably is the property of the American people. At the same time. the Senate Select Committee on Standards and Conduct has voted not really to begin an investigation of a United States senator because of allegations against him that he may have been receiving corporate funds illegally over a period of years. Do you suppose, sir, that events like this contribute to the feeling in the country that maybe there\u2019s something wrong in Washington, and I don\u2019t mean just in the executive branch but throughout the whole government?"}

In the last two years, we have restored integrity in the White House, and we\u2019ve set high standards in the executive branch of the government. The anti-Washington feeling, in my opinion, ought to be focused on the Congress of the United States. For example, this Congress, very shortly, will spend a billion dollars a year for its housekeeping, its salaries, its expenses and the like. It \u2013 the next Congress will probably be the first billion-dollar Congress in the history of the United States. I don\u2019t think the American people are getting their money\u2019s worth from the majority party that run this Congress. We, in addition, see that uh \u2013 in the last uh \u2013 four years the number of employees hired by the Congress has gone up substantial- uh much more than uh \u2013 the gross national product, much more than any other increase throughout our society. Congress is hiring people by the droves, and the cast as a result has gone up. And I don\u2019t see any improvement in the performance of the Congress under the present leadership. So it seems to me instead of the anti-Washington feeling being aimed at everybody in Washington, it seems to me that the focus should be where the problem is, which is the Congress of the United States, and particularly the majority in the Congress. They spend too much money on themselves. They have too many employees. There\u2019s some question about their morality. It seems to me that in this election, the focus should not be on the executive branch but the corrections should come as the voters vote for their members of the House of Representatives or for their United States senator. That\u2019s where the problem is and I hope there\u2019ll be some corrective action taken so we can get some new leadership in the Congress of the United States."}

Even President Nixon, because he was a strong leader at least, worked with a Democratic Congress very well. Uh \u2013 Mr. Ford has vetoed, as I said earlier, four times as many bills per year as Mr. Nixon. Mr. Ford quite often puts forward a program just as a public relations stunt, and never tries to put it through the Congress by working with the Congress. I think under presidents For- uh \u2013 Nixon and Eisenhower they passed about 60 to 75 percent of their legislation. This year Mr. Ford will not pass more than 26 percent of all the legislative proposals he puts forward. This is government by stalemate, and we\u2019ve seen almost a complete breakdown in the proper relationship between the president, who represents this country, and the Congress, who collectively also represent this country. We\u2019ve had uh \u2013 Republican presidents before who\u2019ve tried to run against a Democratic \u2013 uh Congress.

That, I think, is a good balance. But the point is, that \u2013 that a president ought to lead this country. Mr. Ford, so far as I know, except for avoiding another Watergate, has not accomplished one single major program for this country. And there\u2019s been a constant squabbling between the president and the Congress, and that\u2019s not the way this country ought to be run. I might go back to one other thing. Mr. Ford has uh \u2013 misquoted an AP uh \u2013 news story that was in error to begin with. That story reported several times that I would lower taxes for low and middle-income families and uh \u2013 that correction was delivered to the White House and I am sure that the president knows about this uh \u2013 correction, but he still insists uh \u2013 on repeating an erroneous statement."}

The Federal Reserve has uh \u2013 an independent status that ought to be preserved; I think that Mr. uh \u2013 Burns did take a typical, erroneous Republican attitude in the 1973 year when inflation was so high. They assumed that the uh \u2013 inflation rate was because of excessive demand and uh \u2013 therefore put into effect tight constraint on the economy, very high interest rates, which is typical also of the Republican administration, uh \u2013 tried to increase the uh \u2013 the tax uh \u2013 payments by individuals, and cut the tax payments by corporations.

FORD","Text":"The chairman of the Federal Reserve Board should be independent. Fortunately, he has been during Democratic as well as Republican administrations. As the result in the last uh \u2013 two years uh \u2013 we have had a responsible monetary policy. Uh the Federal Reserve Board indicated that the supply of money would be held between four to four and a half and seven and seven and a half. They have done a good job in integrating the money supply with the uh \u2013 fiscal policy of the uh \u2013 executive and legislative branches of the government. It would be catastrophic if the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board became the tool of the political uh \u2013 party that was in power. It\u2019s important for our future uhh \u2013 economic security that that job be nonpolitical and uh \u2013 separate from the executive and the Legislative branches."}

DREW","Text":"Uh Mr. President, the real problem with the FBI and, in fact, all of the intelligence agencies is there are no real laws governing them. Such laws as there are tend to be vague and open-ended. Now, you have issued some executive orders, but we\u2019ve learned that leaving these agencies to executive discretion and direction can get them and, in fact, the country in a great deal of trouble. One president may be a decent man, the next one might not be. So, what do you think about trying to write in some more protection by getting some laws governing these agencies?"}

FORD","Text":"You are familiar, of course, with the fact that I am the first president in thirty years who has reorganized the intelligence agencies in the federal government: the CIA, the Defense Intelligence Agency, the National Security Agency and the others. We\u2019ve done that by executive order. Uhh \u2013 and I think uh \u2013 we\u2019ve tightened it up; we\u2019ve uh \u2013 straightened out their problems that developed over the last few years. It doesn\u2019t seem to me that it\u2019s needed or necessary to have legislation in this particular regard. Uhh \u2013 I have recommended to the Congress, however \u2013 I\u2019m sure you\u2019re familiar with this \u2013 legislation that would uhh \u2013 make it uhh \u2013 very uhh \u2013 proper in \u2013 in the right way, that the attorney general could go in and get the right for wiretapping under security cases. This was an effort that was made by the attorney general and myself, working with the Congress. But even in this area, where I think new legislation would be justified, uh the Congress has not responded. So, I feel in that case, as well as in the reorganization of the intelligence agencies, as I\u2019ve done, we have to do it by executive order. And I\u2019m glad that we have a good director in George Bush. We have good executive orders, and the CIA and the DIA and NASA uh \u2013 uh \u2013 NSA are now doing a good job under proper supervision."}

{"Title":"September 23, 1976 Debate Transcript","Debate":"The First Carter-Ford Presidential Debate","Date":"September 23, 1976","Participants":"Carter-Ford","Moderators":"EDWIN NEWMAN","Speaker":"MR. CARTER","Text":"Well, tonight we\u2019ve had a chance to talk a lot about the past. But I think it\u2019s time to talk about the future. Our nation in the last eight years has been divided as never before. It\u2019s a time for unity. It\u2019s a time to draw ourselves together: to have a president and a Congress that can work together with mutual respect for a change, cooperating for a change, in the open for a change, so the people can understand their own government. It\u2019s time for government, industry, labor, manufacturing, agriculture, education, other entities in our society to cooperate. And it\u2019s a time for government to understand and to cooperate with our people. For a long time our American citizens have been excluded, sometimes misled, sometimes have been lied to. This is uh \u2013 not compatible with the purpose of our nation. I believe in our country. It needs to be competent. The government needs to be well-managed, efficient, economical, We need to have a government that\u2019s sensitive to our people\u2019s needs \u2013 to those who are poor, who don\u2019t have adequate health care, who have been cheated too long with our tax programs, who\u2019ve been out of jobs, whose families have been torn apart. We need to restore the faith and the trust of the American people in their own government. In addition to that, we\u2019ve suffered because we haven\u2019t had leadership in this administration. We\u2019ve got a government of stalemate. We\u2019ve lost the vision of what our country can and ought to be. This is not the America that we\u2019ve known in the past. It\u2019s not the America that we have to have in the future. I don\u2019t claim to know all the answers. But I\u2019ve got confidence in my country. Our economic strength is still there. Our system of government \u2013 in spite of Vietnam, Cambodia, CIA, Watergate \u2013 is still the best system of government on earth. And the greatest resource of all are the two hundred and fifteen million Americans who have within us the strength, the character, the intelligence, the experience, the patriotism, the idealism, the compassion, the sense of brotherhood on which we can rely in the future to restore the greatness to our country We ought not to be excluded from our government anymore. We need a president who can go in \u2013 who derives his strength from the people. I owe the special interests nothing. I owe everything to you, the people of this country. And I believe that we can bind our wounds. I believe that we can work together. And I believe that if we can tap the tremendous untapped reservoir of innate strength in this country, that we can once again have a government as good as our people, and let the world know what we still know and hope for \u2013 that we still live in the greatest and the strongest and the best country on earth."}

{"Title":"September 23, 1976 Debate Transcript","Debate":"The First Carter-Ford Presidential Debate","Date":"September 23, 1976","Participants":"Carter-Ford","Moderators":"EDWIN NEWMAN","Speaker":"MR. FORD","Text":"On November second all of you will make a very, very important decision. One of the major issues in this campaign is trust. A president should never promise more than he can deliver and a president should always deliver everything that he\u2019s promised. A president can\u2019t be all things to all people. A president should be the same thing to all people. Another issue in this campaign, Governor Carter has endorsed the Democratic platform, which calls for more spending, bigger deficits, more inflation or mare taxes. Governor Carter has embraced the record of the present Congress, dominated by his political party. It calls for more of the same. Governor Carter in his acceptance speech called for more and more programs, which means more and more government. I think the real issue in this campaign, and that which you must decide on November second, is whether you should vote for his promise or my performance in two years in the White House. On the fourth of July we had a wonderful two hundredth birthday \u2013 for our great country. It was a superb occasion. It was a glorious day. In the first century of our nation\u2019s history our forefathers gave us the finest form of government in the history of mankind. In the second century of our nation\u2019s history, our forefathers developed the most productive industrial nation in the history of the globe. Our third century should be the century of individual freedom for all our two hundred and fifteen million Americans today and all that join us. In the last few years government has gotten bigger and bigger; industry has gotten larger and larger; labor unions have gotten bigger and bigger; and our children have been the victims of mass education. We must make this next century the century of the individual. We should never forget that a government big enough to give us everything we want is a government big enough to take from us everything we have. The individual worker in the plants throughout the United States should not be a small cog in a big machine. The member of a labor union must have his rights strengthened and broadened and our children in their education should have an opportunity to improve themselves based on their talents and their abilities. My mother and father, during the Depression, worked very hard to give me an opportunity to do better in our great country. Your mothers and fathers did the same thing for you and others. Betty and I have worked very hard to give our children a brighter future in the United States, our beloved country. You and others in this great country have worked hard and done a great deal to give your children and your grandchildren the blessings of a better America. I believe we can all work together to make the individuals in the future have more and all of us working together can build a better America."}

The next presidential debate is to take place on Wednesday, October sixth, in San Francisco at nine-thirty P. M., Eastern Daylight Time. The topics are to be foreign and defense issues. As with all three debates between the presidential candidates and the one between the vice-presidential candidates, it is being arranged by the League of Women Voters Education Fund in the hope of promoting a wider and better informed participation by the American people in the election in November.
