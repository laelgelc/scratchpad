Now, should people pay more for Medicare if they can? Yes. Should they pay more for Social Security if they get more out of it than they paid in, they\u2019re upper income people? Yes. But look what\u2019s happened to the middle class. Middle class Americans are working harder for less money than they were making ten years ago and they\u2019re paying higher taxes. The tax burden on them has not gone down. It has gone up. I don\u2019t think the answer is to slow the economy down more, drive unemployment up more and undermine the health of the private sector. The answer is to invest and grow this economy. That\u2019s what works in other countries and that\u2019s what\u2019ll work here."}

Yes, I did. And the American taxpayer ought to be glad they have a president to stand up to a spending Congress. We remember what it was like when we had a spending president and a spending Congress, and interest rates \u2014 who remembers that? They were at 21.5% under Jimmy Carter, and inflation was 15.

I\u2019ll give you an example. He talks about all the jobs he\u2019s created in one or 2 years. Over the last ten years since he\u2019s been governor, they\u2019re 30% behind, 30% \u2014 they\u2019re 30% of the national average.
