I\u2019m Bill Shadel of ABC News. It\u2019s my privilege this evening to preside at this the third in the series of meetings on radio and television of the two major presidential candidates. Now like the last meeting the subjects to be discussed will be suggested by questions from a panel of correspondents. Unlike the first two programs, however, the two candidates will not be sharing the same platform. In New York the Democratic presidential nominee, Senator John F.

Now, as you\u2019ve probably noted, the four reporters include a newspaper man and a magazine reporter; these two selected by lot by the press secretaries of the candidates from among the reporters traveling with the candidates. The broadcasting representatives were chosen by their companies. The rules for this evening have been agreed upon by the representatives of both candidates and the radio and television networks and I should like to read them. There will be no opening statements by the candidates nor any closing summation. The entire hour will be devoted to answering questions from the reporters. Each candidate to be questioned in turn with opportunity for comment by the other. Each answer will be limited to two and one-half minutes, each comment to one and a half minutes. The reporters are free to ask any question they choose on any subject. Neither candidate knows what questions will be asked. Time alone will dete- determine who will be asked the final question. Now the first question is from Mr. McGee and is for Senator Kennedy."}

That has been reinforced by direct commitments of the president of the United States; it\u2019s been reinforced by a number of other nations under NATO. I\u2019ve stated on many occasions that the United States must meet its commitment on Berlin. It is a commitment that we have to meet if we\u2019re going to protect the security of Western Europe. And therefore on this question I don\u2019t think that there is any doubt in the mind of any American; I hope there is not any doubt in the mind of any member of the community of West Berlin; I\u2019m sure there isn\u2019t any doubt in the mind of the Russians. We will meet our commitments to maintain the freedom and independence of West Berlin."}

NIXON","Text":"Yes. As a matter of fact, the statement that Senator Kennedy made was that \u2013 to the effect that there were trigger-happy Republicans, that my stand on Quemoy and Matsu was an indication of trigger-happy Republicans. I resent that comment. I resent it because th- it\u2019s an implication that Republicans have been trigger-happy and, therefore, would lead this nation into war. I would remind Senator Kennedy of the past fifty years. I would ask him to name one Republican president who led this nation into war. There were three Democratic presidents who led us into war. I do not mean by that that one party is a war party and the other party is a peace party. But I do say that any statement to the effect that the Republican party is trigger-happy is belied by the record. We had a war when we came into power in 1953. We got rid of that; we\u2019ve kept out of other wars; and certainly that doesn\u2019t indicate that we\u2019re trigger-happy. We\u2019ve been strong, but we haven\u2019t been trigger-happy. As far as Berlin is concerned, there isn\u2019t any question about the necessity of defending Berlin; the rights of people there to be free; and there isn\u2019t any question about what the united American people \u2013 Republicans and Democrats alike \u2013 would do in the event there were an attempt by the Communists to take over Berlin."}

If you were president and the Chinese Communists tomorrow began an invasion of Quemoy and Matsu, would you launch the uh \u2013 United States into a war by sending the Seventh Fleet and other military forces to resist this aggression; and secondly, if the uh \u2013 regular conventional forces failed to halt such uh \u2013 such an invasion, would you authorize the use of nuclear weapons?"}
{"Title":"October 13, 1960 Debate Transcript","Debate":"The Third Kennedy-Nixon Presidential Debate","Date":"October 13, 1960","Participants":"Kennedy-Nixon","Moderators":"BILL SHADEL","Speaker":"MR. NIXON","Text":"Mr. Von Fremd, it would be completely irresponsible for a candidate for the presidency, or for a president himself, to indicate the course of action and the weapons he would use in the event of such an attack. I will say this: in the event that such an attack occurred and in the event the attack was a prelude to an attack on Formosa \u2013 which would be the indication today because the Chinese Communists say over and over again that their objective is not the offshore islands, that they consider them only steppingstones to taking Formosa \u2013 in the event that their attack then were a prelude to an attack on Formosa, there isn\u2019t any question but that the United States would then again, as in the case of Berlin, honor our treaty obligations and stand by our ally of Formosa. But to indicate in advance how we would respond, to indicate the nature of this response would be incorrect; it would certainly be inappropriate; it would not be in the best interests of the United States. I will only say this, however, in addition: to do what Senator Kennedy has suggested \u2013 to suggest that we will surrender these islands or force our Chinese Nationalist allies to surrender them in advance \u2013 is not something that would lead to peace; it is something that would lead, in my opinion, to war. This is the history of dealing with dictators. This is something that Senator Kennedy and all Americans must know. We tried this with Hitler. It didn\u2019t work. He wanted first uh \u2013 we know, Austria, and then he went on to the Sudetenland and then Danzig, and each time it was thought this is all that he wanted. Now what do the Chinese Communists want? They don\u2019t want just Quemoy and Matsu; they don\u2019t want just Formosa; they want the world. And the question is if you surrender or indicate in advance that you\u2019re not going to defend any part of the free world, and you figure that\u2019s going to satisfy them, it doesn\u2019t satisfy them. It only whets their appetite; and then the question comes, when do you stop them? I\u2019ve often heard President Eisenhower in discussing this question, make the statement that if we once start the process of indicating that this point or that point is not the place to stop those who threaten the peace and freedom of the world, where do we stop them? And I say that those of us who stand against surrender of territory \u2013 this or any others \u2013 in the face of blackmail, in the s- face of force by the Communists are standing for the course that will lead to peace."}

{"Title":"October 13, 1960 Debate Transcript","Debate":"The Third Kennedy-Nixon Presidential Debate","Date":"October 13, 1960","Participants":"Kennedy-Nixon","Moderators":"BILL SHADEL","Speaker":"MR. KENNEDY","Text":"Yes. The whole th- the United States now has a treaty \u2013 which I voted for in the United States Senate in 1955 \u2013 to defend Formosa and the Pescadores Island. The islands which Mr. Nixon is discussing are five or four miles, respectively, off the coast of China. Now when Senator Green, the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, wrote to the President, he received back on the second of October, 1958 \u2013 \u201cneither you nor any other American need feel the U.S. will be involved in military hostilities merely in the defense of Quemoy and Matsu.\u201d Now, that is the issue. I believe we must meet our commitment to uh \u2013 Formosa. I support it and the Pescadores Island. That is the present American position. The treaty does not include these two islands. Mr. Nixon suggests uh \u2013 that the United States should go to war if these two islands are attacked. I suggest that if Formosa is attacked or the Pescadores, or if there\u2019s any military action in any area which indicates an attack on Formosa and the Pescadores, then of course the United States is at war to defend its treaty. Now, I must say what Mr. Nixon wants to do is commit us \u2013 as I understand him, so that we can be clear if there\u2019s a disagreement \u2013 he wants us to be committed to the defense of these islands merely as the defense of these islands as free territory, not as part of the defense of Formosa. Admiral Yarnell, the commander of the Asiatic fleet, has said that these islands are not worth the bones of a single American. The President of the United States has indicated they are not within the treaty area. They were not within the treaty area when the treaty was passed in fifty-five. We have attempted to persuade Chiang Kai-shek as late as January of 1959 to reduce the number of troops he has on them. This is a serious issue, and I think we ought to understand completely if we disagree, and if so, where."}

And do you think that there can be any new initiatives on the grounds of nuclear disarmament uh \u2013 nuclear control or weapons control d- uh \u2013 during this period?"}
{"Title":"October 13, 1960 Debate Transcript","Debate":"The Third Kennedy-Nixon Presidential Debate","Date":"October 13, 1960","Participants":"Kennedy-Nixon","Moderators":"BILL SHADEL","Speaker":"MR. KENNEDY","Text":"Well I think we should st- strengthen our conventional forces, and we should attempt in January, February, and March of next year to increase the airlift capacity of our conventional forces. Then I believe that we should move full time on our missile production, particularly on Minuteman and on Polaris. It may be a long period, but we must \u2013 we must get started immediately. Now on the question of disarmament, particularly nuclear disarmament, I must say that I feel that another effort should be made by a new Administration in January of 1961, to renew negotiations with the Soviet Union and see whether it\u2019s possible to come to some conclusion which will lessen the chances of contamination of the atmosphere, and also lessen the chances that other powers will begin to possess a nuclear capacity. There are indications, because of new inventions, that ten, fifteen, or twenty nations will have a nuclear capacity \u2013 including Red China \u2013 by the end of the presidential office in 1964. This is extremely serious. There have been many wars in the history of mankind. And to take a chance uh \u2013 now be \u2013 and not make every effort that we could make to provide for some control over these weapons, I think would be a great mistake. One of my disagreements with the present Administration has been that I don\u2019t feel a real effort has been made an this very sensitive subject, not only of nuclear controls, but also of general disarmament. Less than a hundred people have been working throughout the entire federal government on this subject, and I believe it\u2019s been reflected in our success and failures at Geneva. Now, we may not succeed. The Soviet Union may not agree to an inspection system. We may be able to get satisfactory assurances. It may be necessary for us to begin testing again. But I hope the next Administration \u2013 and if I have anything to do with it, the next Administration will \u2013 make one last great effort to provide for control of nuclear testing, control of nuclear weapons, if possible, control of outer space, free from weapons, and also to begin again the subject of general disarmament levels. These must be done. If we cannot succeed, then we must strengthen ourselves. But I would make the effort because I think the fate not only of our own civilization, but I think the fate of world and the future of the human race is involved in preventing a nuclear war."}

{"Title":"October 13, 1960 Debate Transcript","Debate":"The Third Kennedy-Nixon Presidential Debate","Date":"October 13, 1960","Participants":"Kennedy-Nixon","Moderators":"BILL SHADEL","Speaker":"MR. NIXON","Text":"Yes. I am going to make a major speech on this whole subject next week before the next debate, and I will have an opportunity then to answer any other questions that may arise with regard to my position on it. There isn\u2019t any question but that we must move forward in every possible way to reduce the danger of war; to move toward controlled disarmament; to control tests; but also let\u2019s have in mind this: when Senator Kennedy suggests that we haven\u2019t been making an effort, he simply doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s talking about. It isn\u2019t a question of the number of people who are working in an Administration. It\u2019s a question of who they are. This has been one of the highest level operations in the whole State Department right under the President himself. We have gone certainly the extra mile and then some in making offers to the Soviet Union on control of tests, on disarmament, and in every other way. And I just want to make one thing very clear. Yes, we should make a great effort. But under no circumstances must the United States ever make an agreement based on trust. There must be an absolute guarantee. Now, just a comment on Senator Kennedy\u2019s last answer. He forgets that in this same debate on the Formosa resolution, which he said he voted for \u2013 which he did \u2013 that he voted against an amendment, or was recorded against an amendment \u2013 and on this particular \u2013 or for an amendment, I should say \u2013 which passed the Senate overwhelmingly, seventy to twelve. And that amendment put the Senate of the United States on record with a majority of the Senator\u2019s own party voting for it, as well as the majority of Republicans \u2013 put them on record \u2013 against the very position that the Senator takes now of surrendering, of indicating in advance, that the United States will not defend the offshore islands."}

DRUMMOND","Text":"Mr. Nixon, I would like to ask eh \u2013 one more aspect or raise another aspect of this same question. Uh \u2013 it is my understanding that President Eisenhower never advocated that Quemoy and Matsu should be defended under all circumstances as a matter of principle. I heard Secretary Dulles at a press conference in fifty-eight say that he thought that it was a mistake for Chiang Kai-shek to deploy troops to these islands. I would like to ask what has led you to take what appears to be a different position on this subject."}
{"Title":"October 13, 1960 Debate Transcript","Debate":"The Third Kennedy-Nixon Presidential Debate","Date":"October 13, 1960","Participants":"Kennedy-Nixon","Moderators":"BILL SHADEL","Speaker":"MR. NIXON","Text":"Well Mr. Drummond, first of all, referring to Secretary Dulles\u2019 press conference, I think if you read it all \u2013 and I know that you have \u2013 you will find that Secretary Dulles also indicated in that press conference that when the troops were withdrawn from Quemoy, that the implication was certainly of everything that he said, that Quemoy could better be defended. There were too many infantrymen there, not enough heavy artillery; and certainly I don\u2019t think there was any implication in Secretary Dulles\u2019 statement that Quemoy and Matsu should not be defended in the event that they were attacked, and that attack was a preliminary to an attack on Formosa. Now as far as President Eisenhower is concerned, I have often heard him discuss this question. As I uh \u2013 related a moment ago, the President has always indicated that we must not make the mistake in dealing with the dictator of indicating that we are going to make a concession at the point of a gun. Whenever you do that, inevitably the dictator is encouraged to try it again. So first it will be Quemoy and Matsu, next it may be Formosa. What do we do then? My point is this: that once you do this \u2013 follow this course of action \u2013 of indicating that you are not going to defend a particular area, the inevitable result is that it encourages a man who is determined to conquer the world to press you to the point of no return. And that means war. We went through this tragic experience leading to World War II. We learned our lesson again in Korea, We must not learn it again. That is why I think the Senate was right, including a majority of the Democrats, a majority of the Republicans, when they rejected Senator Kennedy\u2019s position in 1955. And incidentally, Senator Johnson was among those who rejected that position \u2013 voted with the seventy against the twelve. The Senate was right because they knew the lesson of history. And may I say, too, that I would trust that Senator Kennedy would change his position on this \u2013 change it; because as long as he as a major presidential candidate continues to suggest that we are going to turn over these islands, he is only encouraging the aggressors \u2013 the Chinese Communist and the Soviet aggressors \u2013 to press the United States, to press us to the point where war would be inevitable. The road to war is always paved with good intentions. And in this instance the good intentions, of course, are a desire for peace. But certainly we\u2019re not going to have peace by giving in and indicating in advance that we are not going to defend what has become a symbol of freedom."}

KENNEDY","Text":"I don\u2019t think it\u2019s possible for Mr. Nixon to state the record in distortion of the facts with more precision than he just did. In 1955, Mr. Dulles at a press conference said: \u201cThe treaty that we have with the Republic of China excludes Quemoy and Matsu from the treaty area.\u201d That was done with much thought and deliberation. Therefore that treaty does not commit the United States to defend anything except Formosa and the Pescadores, and to deal with acts against that treaty area. I completely sustained the treaty. I voted for it. I would take any action necessary to defend the treaty, Formosa, and the Pescadores Island. What we\u2019re now talking about is the Vice President\u2019s determination to guarantee Quemoy and Matsu, which are four and five miles off the coast of Red China, which are not within the treaty area. I do not suggest that Chiang Kai-shek \u2013 and this Administration has been attempting since 1955 to persuade Chiang Kai-shek to lessen his troop commitments. Uh \u2013 He sent a mission \u2013 the President \u2013 in 1955 of Mr. uh \u2013 Robertson and Admiral Radford. General Twining said they were still doing it in 1959. General Ridgway said \u2013 who was Chief of Staff: \u201cTo go to war for Quemoy and Matsu to me would seem an unwarranted and tragic course to take. To me that concept is completely repugnant.\u201d So I stand with them. I stand with the Secretary of State, Mr. Herter, who said these islands were indefensible. I believe that we should meet our commitments, and if the Chinese Communists attack the Pescadores and Formosa, they know that it will mean a war. I would not ho- hand over these islands under any point of gun. But I merely say that the treaty is quite precise and I sustain the treaty. Mr. Nixon would add a guarantee to islands five miles off the coast of the re- Republic of China when he\u2019s never really protested the Communists seizing Cuba, ninety miles off the coast of the United States."}

I just do want to say one thing, however. We all have tempers; I have one; I\u2019m sure Senator Kennedy has one. But when a man\u2019s president of the United States, or a former president, he has an obligation not to lose his temper in public. One thing I\u2019ve noted as I\u2019ve traveled around the country are the tremendous number of children who come out to see the presidential candidates. I see mothers holding their babies up, so that they can see a man who might be president of the United States. I know Senator Kennedy sees them, too. It makes you realize that whoever is president is going to be a man that all the children of America will either look up to, or will look down to. And I can only say that I\u2019m very proud that President Eisenhower restored dignity and decency and, frankly, good language to the conduct of the presidency of the United States. And I only hope that, should I win this election, that I could approach President Eisenhower in maintaining the dignity of the office; in seeing to it that whenever any mother or father talks to his child, he can look at the man in the White House and, whatever he may think of his policies, he will say: \u201cWell, there is a man who maintains the kind of standards personally that I would want my child to follow.\u201d"}

I have supported the Administration\u2019s position and I think that that position has been correct; I think my position has been correct. As far as Indochina was concerned, I stated over and over again that it was essential during that period that the United States make it clear that we would not tolerate Indochina falling under Communist domination. Now, as a result of our taking the strong stand that we did, the civil war there was ended; and today, at least in the south of Indochina, the Communists have moved out and we do have a strong, free bastion there. Now, looking to the U-2 flights, I would like to point out that I have been supporting the President\u2019s position throughout. I think the President was correct in ordering these flights. I think the President was correct, certainly, in his decision to continue the flights while the conference was going on. I noted, for example, in reading a \u2013 uh \u2013 a \u2013 a particular discussion that Senator Kennedy had with Dave Garroway shortly after the uh \u2013 his statement about regrets, that uh \u2013 he made the statement that he felt that these particular flights uh \u2013 were ones that shouldn\u2019t have occurred right at that time, and the indication was how would Mr. Khrushchev had felt if we had uh \u2013 had a flight over the uni- how would we have felt if Mr. Khrushchev ha \u2013 uh \u2013 had a flight over the United States while uh \u2013 he was visiting here. And the answer, of course, is that Communist espionage goes on all the time. The answer is that the United States can\u2019t afford to have a es- an es \u2013 a espionage lack or should we s- uh \u2013 lag \u2013 or should I say uh \u2013 an intelligence lag \u2013 any more than we can afford to have a missile lag. Now, referring to your question with regard to Quemoy and Matsu. What I object to here is the constant reference to surrendering these islands. Senator Kennedy quotes the record, which he read from a moment ago, but what he forgets to point out is that the key vote \u2013 a uh \u2013 vote which I\u2019ve referred to several times \u2013 where he was in the minority was one which rejected his position. Now, why did they reject it? For the very reason that those Senators knew, as the President of the United States knew, that you should not indicate to the Communists in advance that you\u2019re going to surrender an area that\u2019s free. Why? Because they know as Senator Kennedy will have to know that if you do that you encourage them to more aggression."}

Number two, on the question of the U-2 flights. I thought the. U-2 flight in May just before the conference was a mistake in timing because of the hazards involved, if the summit conference had any hope for success. I never criticized the U-2 flights in general, however. I never suggested espionage should stop. It still goes on, I would assume, on both sides. Number three, the Vice President \u2013 on May fifteenth after the U-2 flight \u2013 indicated that the flights were going on, even though the Administration and the President had canceled the flights on May twelfth. Number three, the pre \u2013 Vice President suggests that we should keep the Communists in doubt about whether we would fight on Quemoy and Matsu. That\u2019s not the position he\u2019s taking. He\u2019s indicating that we should fight for these islands come what may because they are, in his words, in the area of freedom. He didn\u2019t take that position on Tibet. He didn\u2019t take that position on Budapest. He doesn\u2019t take that position that I\u2019ve seen so far in Laos. Guinea and Ghana have both moved within the Soviet sphere of influence in foreign policy; so has Cuba. I merely say that the United States should meet its commitments to Que- to uh \u2013 Formosa and the Pescadores. But as Admiral Yarnell has said, and he\u2019s been supported by most military authority, these islands that we\u2019re now talking about are not worth the bones of a single American soldier; and I know how difficult it is to sustain troops close to the shore under artillery bombardment. And therefore, I think, we should make it very clear the disagreement between Mr. Nixon and myself. He\u2019s extending the Administration\u2019s commitment."}

And that means, of course, the best man that this nation can produce. And that means that we can\u2019t have any test of religion. We can\u2019t have any test of race. It must be a test of a man. Also as far as religion is concerned. I have seen Communism abroad. I see what it does. Communism is the enemy of all religions; and we who do believe in God must join together. We must not be divided on this issue. The worst thing that I can think can happen in this campaign would be for it to be decided on religious issues.

NIXON","Text":"Mr. McGee, I am planning a speech on that subject next week. Uh \u2013 Also, so that we can get the uh \u2013 opportunity for the questioners to question me, it will be before the next television debate. Uh \u2013 I will say simply, in advance of it, that I believe that in this area, the laws which should be passed uh \u2013 as far as the big national emergency strikes are concerned, are ones that will give the president more weapons with which to deal with those strikes. Now, I have a basic disagreement with Senator Kennedy, though, on this point. He has taken the position, when he first indicated in October of last year, that he would even favor compulsory arbitration as one of the weapons the president might have to stop a national emergency strike. I understand in his last speech before the Steelworkers Union, that he changed that position and indicated that he felt that government seizure might be the best way to stop a strike which could not be settled by collective bargaining. I do not believe we should have either compulsory arbitration or seizure. I think the moment that you give to the union, on the one side, and to management, on the other side, the escape hatch of eventually going to government to get it settled, that most of these great strikes will end up being settled by government, and that will be a \u2013 be in the end, in my opinion, wage control; it would mean price control \u2013 all the things that we do not want. I do believe, however, that we can give to the president of the United States powers, in addition to what he presently has in the fact finding area, which would enable him to be more effective than we have been in handling these strikes. One last point I should make. The record in handling them has been very good during this Administration. We have had less man-hours lost by strikes in these last seven years than we had in the previous seven years, by a great deal. And I only want to say that however good the record is, it\u2019s got to be better. Because in this critical year \u2013 period of the sixties we\u2019ve got to move forward, all Americans must move forward together, and we have to get the greatest cooperation possible between labor and management. We cannot afford stoppages of massive effect on the economy when we\u2019re in the terrible competition we\u2019re in with the Soviets."}

KENNEDY","Text":"Well, I always have difficulty recognizing my positions when they\u2019re stated by the Vice President. I never suggested that compulsory arbitration was the solution for national emergency disputes. I\u2019m opposed to that, was opposed to it in October, 1958. I have suggested that the president should be given other weapons to protect the national interest in case of national emergency strikes beyond the injunction provision of the Taft-Hartley Act. I don\u2019t know what other weapons the Vice President is talking about. I\u2019m talking about giving him four or five tools \u2013 not only the fact-finding committee that he now has under the injunction provision, not only the injunction, but also the power of the fact-finding commission to make recommendations \u2013 recommendations which would not be binding, but nevertheless would have great force of public opinion behind them. One of the additional powers that I would suggest would be seizure. There might be others. By the president having five powers \u2013 four or five powers \u2013 and he only has very limited powers today, neither the company nor the union would be sure which power would be used; and therefore, there would be a greater incentive on both sides to reach an agreement themselves without taking it to the government. The difficulty now is the president\u2019s course is quite limited. He can set up a fact-finding committee. The fact-finding committee\u2019s powers are limited. He can provide an injunction if there\u2019s a national emergency for eighty days, then the strike can go on; and there are no other powers or actions that the president could take unless he went to the Congress. This is a difficult and sensitive matter. But to state my view precisely, the president should have a variety of things he could do. He could leave the parties in doubt as to which one he would use; and therefore there would be incentive, instead of as now \u2013 the steel companies were ready to take the strike because they felt the injunction of eighty days would break the union, which didn\u2019t happen."}

{"Title":"October 13, 1960 Debate Transcript","Debate":"The Third Kennedy-Nixon Presidential Debate","Date":"October 13, 1960","Participants":"Kennedy-Nixon","Moderators":"BILL SHADEL","Speaker":"MR. KENNEDY","Text":"Yes, I have stated in both uh \u2013 debates and state again that I believe in a balanced budget and have supported that concept during my fourteen years in the Congress. The only two times when an unbalanced budget is warranted would be during a serious recession \u2013 and we had that in fifty-eight in an unbalanced budget of twelve billion dollars \u2013 or a national emergency where there should be large expenditures for national defense, which we had in World War II and uh \u2013 during part of the Korean War. On the question of the cost of our budget, I have stated that it\u2019s my best judgment that our agricultural program will cost a billion and a half, possibly two billion dollars less than the present agricultural program. My judgment is that the program the Vice President put forward, which is an extension of Mr. Benson\u2019s program, will cost a billion dollars more than the present program, which costs about six billion dollars a year, the most expensive in history. We\u2019ve spent more money on agriculture in the last eight years than the hundred years of the Agricultural Department before that. Secondly, I believe that the high interest-rate policy that this Administration has followed has added about three billion dollars a year to interest on the debt \u2013 merely funding the debt \u2013 which is a burden an the taxpayers. I would hope, under a different monetary policy, that it would be possible to reduce that interest-rate burden, at least a billion dollars. Third, I think it\u2019s possible to gain a seven hundred million to a billion dollars through tax changes which I believe would close up loof- loopholes on dividend withholding, on expense accounts. Fourthly, I have suggested that the medical care for the aged \u2013 and the bill which the Congress now has passed and the President signed if fully implemented would cost a billion dollars on the Treasury \u2013 out of Treasury funds and a billion dollars by the states \u2013 the proposal that I have put forward and which many of the members of my party support is for medical care financed under Social Security; which would be financed under the Social Security taxes; which is less than three cents a day per person for medical care, doctors\u2019 bills, nurses, hospitals, when they retire. It is actuarially sound. So in my judgment we would spend more money in this Administration on aid to education, we\u2019d spend more money on housing, we\u2019d spend more money and I hope more wisely on defense than this Administration has. But I believe that the next Administration should work for a balanced budget, and that would be my intention. Mr. Nixon misstates my figures constantly, which uh \u2013 is of course his right, but the fact of the matter is: here is where I stand and I just want to have it on the public record."}

I will issue a white paper after this broadcast, quoting exactly what he said on compulsory arbitration, for example, and the record will show that I have been correct. Now as far as his figures are concerned here tonight, he again is engaging in this, what I would call, mirror game of \u201chere-it-is-and-here-it-isn\u2019t.\u201d Uh \u2013 On the one hand, for example, he suggests that as far as his medical care program is concerned that that really isn\u2019t a problem because it\u2019s from Social Security. But Social Security is a tax. The people pay it. It comes right out of your paycheck. This doesn\u2019t mean that the people aren\u2019t going to be paying the bill. He also indicates as far as his agricultural program is concerned that he feels it will cost less than ours. Well, all that I can suggest is that all the experts who have studied the program indicate that it is the most fantastic program, the worst program, insofar as its effect on the farmers, that the \u2013 America has ever had foisted upon it in an election year or any other time. And I would also point out that Senator Kennedy left out a part of the cost of that program \u2013 a twenty-five percent rise in food prices that the people would have to pay. Now are we going to have that when it isn\u2019t going to help the farmers? I don\u2019t think we should have that kind of a program. Then he goes on to say that he\u2019s going to change the interest-rate situation and we\u2019re going to get some more money that way. Well, what he is saying there in effect, we\u2019re going to have inflation.

Uh \u2013 Is it fair, therefore, Mr. Vice President, to conclude that you feel that there has been insufficient economic growth during the past eight years; and if so, what would you do beyond uh \u2013 present Administration policies uh \u2013 to step it up?"}
{"Title":"October 13, 1960 Debate Transcript","Debate":"The Third Kennedy-Nixon Presidential Debate","Date":"October 13, 1960","Participants":"Kennedy-Nixon","Moderators":"BILL SHADEL","Speaker":"MR. NIXON","Text":"Mr. Drummond, I am never satisfied with the economic growth of this country. I\u2019m not satisfied with it even if there were no Communism in the world, but particularly when we\u2019re in the kind of a race we\u2019re in, we have got to see that America grows just as fast as we can, provided we grow soundly. Because even though we have maintained, as I pointed out in our first debate, the absolute gap over the Soviet Union; even though the growth in this Administration has been twice as much as it was in the Truman Administration; that isn\u2019t good enough. Because America must be able to grow enough not only to take care of our needs at home for better education and housing and health \u2013 all these things we want. We\u2019ve got to grow enough to maintain the forces that we have abroad and to wage the non-military battle for the war \u2013 uh \u2013 for the world in Asia, in Africa and Latin America. It\u2019s going to cost more money, and growth will help us to win that battle. Now, what do we do about it? And here I believe basically that what we have to do is to stimulate that sector of America, the private enterprise sector of the economy, in which there is the greatest possibility for expansion. So that is why I advocate a program of tax reform which will stimulate more investment in our economy. In addition to that, we have to move on other areas that are holding back growth. I refer, for example, to distressed areas. We have to move into those areas with programs so that we make adequate use of the resources of those areas. We also have to see that all of the people of the United States \u2013 the tremendous talents that our people have \u2013 are used adequately. That\u2019s why in this whole area of civil rights, the equality of opportunity for employment and education is not just for the benefit of the minority groups, it\u2019s for the benefit of the nation so that we can get the scientists and the engineers and all the rest that we need. And in addition to that, we need programs, particularly in higher education, which will stimulate scientific breakthroughs which will bring more growth. Now what all this, of course, adds up to is this: America has not been standing still. Let\u2019s get that straight. Anybody who says America\u2019s been standing still for the last seven and a half years hasn\u2019t been traveling around America. He\u2019s been traveling in some other country. We have been moving. We have been moving much faster than we did in the Truman years. But we can and must move faster, and that\u2019s why I stand so strongly for programs that will move America forward in the sixties, move her forward so that we can stay ahead of the Soviet Union and win the battle for freedom and peace."}

KENNEDY","Text":"Well first may I correct a statement which was made before, that under my agricultural program food prices would go up twenty-five percent. That\u2019s untrue. The fa- the farmer who grows wheat gets about two and a half cents out of a twenty-five-cent loaf of bread. Even if you put his income up ten percent, that would be two and three-quarters percent three pers- or three cents out of that twenty-five cents. The t- man who grows tomatoes \u2013 it costs less for those tomatoes than it does for the label on the can. And I believe when the average hour for many farmers\u2019 wage is about fifty cents an hour, he should do better. But anybody who suggests that that program would c- come to any figure indicated by the Vice President is in error. The Vice President suggested a number of things. He suggested that we aid distressed areas. The Administration has vetoed that bill passed by the Congress twice. He suggested we pass an aid to education bill. But the Administration and the Republican majority in the Congress has opposed any realistic aid to education. And the Vice President cast the deciding vote against federal aid for teachers\u2019 salaries in the Senate, which prevented that being added. This Administration and this country last year had the lowest rate of economic growth \u2013 which means jobs \u2013 of any major industrialized society in the world in 1959. And when we have to find twenty-five thousand new jobs a week for the next ten years, we\u2019re going to have to grow more. Governor Rockefeller says five per cent. The Democratic platform and others say five per cent. Many say four and a half per cent. The last eight years the average growth has been about two and a half per cent.

I believe all of those should be gone over in detail to make sure that no one is getting a tax break; to make sure that no one is getting away from paying the taxes he ought to pay. That includes oil; it includes all kinds of minerals; it includes everything within the range of taxation. We want to be sure it\u2019s fair and equitable. It includes oil abroad. Perhaps that oil abroad should be treated differently than the oil here at home. Now the oil industry recently has had hard times. Particularly some of the smaller producers. They\u2019re moving about eight or nine days in Texas. But I can assure you that if I\u2019m elected president, the whole spectrum of taxes will be gone through carefully. And if there is any inequities in oil or any other commodity, then I would vote to close that loophole, I have voted in the past to reduce the depletion allowance for the largest producers; for those from five million dollars down, to maintain it at twenty-seven and a half per cent. I believe we should study this and other allowances; tax expense, dividend expenses and all the rest, and make a determination of how we can stimulate growth; how we can provide the revenues needed to move our country forward."}

I favor it not because I want to make a lot of oil men rich, but because I want to make America rich. Why do we have a depletion allowance? Because this is the stimulation, the incentive for companies to go out and explore for oil, to develop it. If we didn\u2019t have a depletion allowance of certainly, I believe, the present amount, we would have our oil exploration cut substantially in this country. Now, as far as my position then is concerned, it is exactly opposite to the Senator\u2019s. And it\u2019s because of my belief that if America is going to have the growth that he talks about and that I talk about and that we want, the thing to do is not to discourage individual enterprise, not to discourage people to go out and discover more oil and minerals, but to encourage them. And so he would be doing exactly the wrong thing. One other thing. He suggests that there are a number of other items in this whole depletion field that could be taken into account. He also said a moment ago that we would get more money to finance his programs by revising the tax laws, including depletion. I should point out that as far as depletion allowances are concerned, the oil depletion allowance is one that provides eighty percent of all of those involved in depletion, so you\u2019re not going to get much from revenue insofar as depletion allowances are concerned, unless you move in the area that he indicated. But I oppose it. I oppose it for the reasons that I mentioned. I oppose it because I want us to have more oil exploration and not less."}

{"Title":"October 13, 1960 Debate Transcript","Debate":"The Third Kennedy-Nixon Presidential Debate","Date":"October 13, 1960","Participants":"Kennedy-Nixon","Moderators":"BILL SHADEL","Speaker":"MR. VON FREMD","Text":"Mr. Vice President, in the past three years, there has been an exodus of more than four billion dollars of gold from the United States, apparently for two reasons: because exports have slumped and haven\u2019t covered imports, and because of increased American investments abroad. If you were president, how would you go about stopping this departure of gold from our shores?"}
{"Title":"October 13, 1960 Debate Transcript","Debate":"The Third Kennedy-Nixon Presidential Debate","Date":"October 13, 1960","Participants":"Kennedy-Nixon","Moderators":"BILL SHADEL","Speaker":"MR. NIXON","Text":"Well, Mr. Von Fremd, the first thing we have to do is to continue to keep confidence abroad in the American dollar. That means that we must continue to have a balanced budget here at home in every possible circumstance that we can; because the moment that we have loss of confidence in our own fiscal policies at home, it results in gold flowing out. Secondly, we have to increase our exports, as compared with our imports. And here we have a very strong program going forward in the Department of Commerce. This one must be stepped up. Beyond that, as far as the gold supply is concerned, and as far as the movement of gold is concerned, uh \u2013 we have to bear in mind that we must get more help from our allies abroad in this great venture in which all free men are involved of winning the battle for freedom. Now America has been carrying a tremendous load in this respect. I think we have been right in carrying it. I have favored our programs abroad for economic assistance and for military assistance. But now we find that the countries of Europe for example, that we have aided, and Japan, that we\u2019ve aided in the Far East; these countries \u2013 some our former enemies, have now recovered completely. They have got to bear a greater share of this load of economic assistance abroad. That\u2019s why I am advocating, and will develop during the course of the next Administration \u2013 if, of course, I get the opportunity \u2013 a program in which we enlist more aid from these other countries on a concerted basis in the programs of economic development for Africa, Asia and Latin America. The United States cannot continue to carry the major share of this burden by itself. We can a big share of it, but we\u2019ve got to have more help from our friends abroad; and these three factors, I think, will be very helpful in reversing the gold flow which you spoke about."}

{"Title":"October 13, 1960 Debate Transcript","Debate":"The Third Kennedy-Nixon Presidential Debate","Date":"October 13, 1960","Participants":"Kennedy-Nixon","Moderators":"BILL SHADEL","Speaker":"MR. KENNEDY","Text":"Just to uh \u2013 correct the record, Mr. Nixon said on depletion that his record was the opposite of mine. What I said was that this matter should be thoroughly gone into to make sure that there aren\u2019t loopholes. If his record is the opposite of that, that means that he doesn\u2019t want to go into it. Now on the question of gold. The difficulty, of course, is that we do have heavy obligations abroad, that we therefore have to maintain not only a favorable balance of trade but also send a good deal of our dollars overseas to pay our troops, maintain our bases, and sustain other economies. In other words, if we\u2019re going to continue to maintain our position in the sixties, we have to maintain a sound monetary and fiscal policy. We have to have control over inflation, and we also have to have a favorable balance of trade. We have to be able to compete in the world market. We have to be able to sell abroad more than we consume uh \u2013 from abroad if we\u2019re going to be able to meet our obligations. In addition, many of the countries around the world still keep restrictions against our goads, going all the way back to the days when there was a dollar shortage. Now there isn\u2019t a dollar shortage, and yet many of these countries continue to move against our goods. I believe that we must be able to compete in the market \u2013 steel and in all the basic commodities abroad \u2013 we must be able to compete against them because we always did because of our technological lead. We have to be sure to maintain that. We have to persuade these other countries not to restrict our goods coming in, not to act as if there was a dollar gap; and third, we have to persuade them to assume some of the responsibilities that up till now we\u2019ve maintained, to assist underdeveloped countries in Africa, Latin America and Asia make an economic breakthrough on their own."}

DRUMMOND","Text":"Senator Kennedy, a question on American prestige. In light of the fact that the Soviet Ambassador was recently expelled from the Congo, and that Mr. Khrushchev has this week canceled his trip to Cuba for fear of stirring resentment throughout all Latin America, I would like to ask you to spell out somewhat more fully how you think we should measure American prestige, to determine whether it is rising or whether it is falling."}
{"Title":"October 13, 1960 Debate Transcript","Debate":"The Third Kennedy-Nixon Presidential Debate","Date":"October 13, 1960","Participants":"Kennedy-Nixon","Moderators":"BILL SHADEL","Speaker":"MR. KENNEDY","Text":"Well, I think there are many uh \u2013 tests, Mr. Drummond, of prestige. And the significance of prestige, really, is because we\u2019re so identified with the cause of freedom. Therefore, if we are on the mount, if we are rising, if our influence is spreading, if our prestige is spreading, then those uh \u2013 who stand now on the razor edge of decision between us or between the Communist system, wondering whether they should use the system of freedom to develop their countries or the system of Communism, they\u2019ll be persuaded to follow our example. There have been several indications that our prestige is not as high as it once was. Mr. George Allen, the head of our information service, said that a result of our being second in space, in the sputnik in 1957, and I quote him, I believe I paraphrase him accurately. He said that many of these countries equate space developments with scientific productivity and scientific advancement. And therefore, he said, many of these countries now feel that the Soviet Union, which was once so backward, is now on a par with the United States. Secondly, the economic growth of the Soviet Union is greater than ours. Mr. Dulles has suggested it\u2019s from two to three times as great as ours. This has a great effect on the s- underdeveloped world, which faces problems of low income and high population density and inadequate resources. Three, a Gallup Poll taken in February asked people in ten countries which country they thought would be first in 1970, both scientifically and militarily. And a majority in every country except Greece, felt that it would be the Soviet Union by l970. Four, in the votes at the U.N., particularly the vote dealing with Red China last Saturday, we received the support on the position that we had taken of only two African countries \u2013 one, Liberia, which had been tied to us for more than a century, and the other, Union of South Africa, which is not a popular country in Africa. Every other ca- African country either abstained or voted against us. A \u2013 More countries voted against us in Asia on this issue than voted with us. On the neutralists\u2019 resolution, which we were so much opposed to, the same thing happened. The candidate who was a candidate for the president of Brazil, took a trip to Cuba to call on Mr. Castro during the election in order to get the benefit of the Castro supporters uh \u2013 within Brazil. There are many indications. Guinea and Ghana, two independent countries within the last three years \u2013 Guinea in fifty-seven, Ghana within the last eighteen months \u2013 both now are supporting the Soviet foreign policy at the U.N. Mr. Herter said so himself. Laos is moving in that direction. So I would say our prestige is not so high. No longer do we give the image of being on the rise. No longer do we give an image of vitality."}

{"Title":"October 13, 1960 Debate Transcript","Debate":"The Third Kennedy-Nixon Presidential Debate","Date":"October 13, 1960","Participants":"Kennedy-Nixon","Moderators":"BILL SHADEL","Speaker":"MR. NIXON","Text":"Well, I would say first of all that Senator\u2019s \u2013 Kennedy\u2019s statement that he\u2019s just made is not going to help our Gallup Polls abroad and it isn\u2019t going to help our prestige either. Let\u2019s look at the other side of the coin. Let\u2019s look at the vote on the Congo, the vote was seventy to nothing against the Soviet Union. Let\u2019s look at the situation with regard to economic growth as it really is. We find that the Soviet Union is a very primitive economy. Its growth rate is not what counts; it\u2019s whether it is catching up with us and it is not catching up with us. We\u2019re well ahead and we can stay ahead, provided we have confidence in America and don\u2019t run her down in order to build her up. We could look also at other items which Senator Kennedy has named, but I will only conclude by saying this: in this whole matter of prestige, in the final analysis, its whether you stand for what\u2019s right. And getting back to this matter that we discussed at the outset, the matter of Quemoy and Matsu. I can think of nothing that will be a greater blow to the prestige of the United States among the free nations in Asia than for us to take Senator Kennedy\u2019s advan- advice to go \u2013 go against what a majority of the members of the Senate, both Democrat and Republican, did \u2013 said in 1955, and to say in advance we will surrender an area to the Communists. In other words, if the United States is going to maintain its strength and its prestige, we must not only be strong militarily and economically, we must be firm diplomatically. Thi- Certainly we have been speaking, I know, of whether we should have retreat or defeat. Let\u2019s remember the way to win is not to retreat and not to surrender."}
{"Title":"October 13, 1960 Debate Transcript","Debate":"The Third Kennedy-Nixon Presidential Debate","Date":"October 13, 1960","Participants":"Kennedy-Nixon","Moderators":"BILL SHADEL","Speaker":"MR. SHADEL","Text":"Thank you gentlemen. As we mentioned at the opening of this program, the candidates agreed that the clock alone would determine who had the last word. The two candidates wish to thank the networks for the opportunity to appear for this discussion. I would repeat the ground rules likewise agreed upon by representatives of the two candidates and the radio and television networks. The entire hour was devoted to answering questions from the reporters. Each candidate was questioned in turn and each had the opportunity to comment on the answer of his opponent. The reporters were free to ask any question on any subject. Neither candidate was given any advance information on any question that would be asked. Those were the conditions agreed upon for this third meeting of the candidates tonight. Now I might add that also agreed upon was the fact that when the hour got down to the last few minutes, if there was not sufficient time left for another question and suitable time for answers and comment, the questioning would end at that point. That is the situation at this moment. And after reviewing the rules for this evening I might use the remaining moments of the hour to tell you something about the other arrangements for this debate with the participants a continent apart. I would emphasize first that each candidate was in a studio alone except for three photographers and three reporters of the press and the television technicians. Those studios identical in every detail of lighting, background, physical equipment, even to the paint used in decorating. We newsmen in a third studio have also experienced a somewhat similar isolation. Now, I would remind you the fourth in the series of these historic joint appearances, scheduled for Friday, October twenty-first. At that time the candidates will again share the same platform to discuss foreign policy. This is Bill Shadel. Goodnight."}
