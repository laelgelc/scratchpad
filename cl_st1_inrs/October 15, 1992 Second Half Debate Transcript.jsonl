And it also requires us to maintain some continuity \u2014 some bipartisan American commitment to certain principles.

I think we\u2019re going to have to work to stop the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Got to keep going until all those nuclear weapons in Russia are gone and the other republics. Number 2, if you don\u2019t rebuild the economic strength of this country at home, we won\u2019t be a superpower. We can\u2019t have any more instances like what happened when Mr. Bush went to Japan and the Japanese prime minister said he felt sympathy for our country. We have to be the strongest economic power in the world. That\u2019s what got me into this race, so we could rebuild the American economy."}
