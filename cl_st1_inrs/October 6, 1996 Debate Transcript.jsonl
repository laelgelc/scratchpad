I wanted to turn this country around with a program of opportunity for all, responsibility from all, and an American community where everybody has a role to play. I wanted a government that was smaller and less bureaucratic to help people make the most of their own lives. Four years ago you took me on faith. Now there\u2019s a record: Ten and a half million more jobs, rising incomes, falling crime rates and welfare rolls, a strong America at peace."}

Now, I know millions of you still have anxieties. You work harder and harder to make ends meet and put food on the table.

There is a major difference in your view of the role of the Federal government and that of Senator Dole. How would you define the difference?"}
{"Title":"October 6, 1996 Debate Transcript","Debate":"The First Clinton-Dole Presidential Debate","Date":"October 6, 1996","Participants":"Clinton-Dole","Moderators":"LEHRER","Speaker":"CLINTON","Text":"Well, Jim, I believe that the Federal government should give people the tools and try to establish the conditions in which they can make the most of their own lives. That, to me, is the key. And that leads me to some different conclusions from Senator Dole."}
{"Title":"October 6, 1996 Debate Transcript","Debate":"The First Clinton-Dole Presidential Debate","Date":"October 6, 1996","Participants":"Clinton-Dole","Moderators":"LEHRER","Speaker":"CLINTON","Text":"For example, we have reduced the size of the Federal government to its smallest size in 30 years. We reduced more regulations, eliminated more programs than my two Republican predecessors. But I have worked hard for things like the Family and Medical Leave Law, the Brady Bill, the assault weapons ban, the program to put 100,000 police on the street. All of these are programs that Senator Dole opposed that I supported, because I felt they were a legitimate effort to help people make the most of their own lives. I\u2019ve worked hard to help families impart values to their own children. I supported the V-chip so that parents would be able to control what their kids watch on television when they\u2019re young, along with the ratings systems for television and educational television. I supported strong action against the tobacco companies to stop the marketing, advertising, and sale of tobacco to young people. I supported a big increase in the safe and drug-free schools program. These were areas on which Senator Dole and I differed, but I believed they were the right areas for America to be acting together as one country to help individuals and families make the most of their own lives and raise their kids with good values and a good future."}

{"Title":"October 6, 1996 Debate Transcript","Debate":"The First Clinton-Dole Presidential Debate","Date":"October 6, 1996","Participants":"Clinton-Dole","Moderators":"LEHRER","Speaker":"DOLE","Text":"I think the basic difference is, and I have had some experience in this, I think the basic difference, I trust the people. The President trusts the government. We go back and look at the healthcare plan that he wanted to impose on the American people. One seventh the total economy, 17 new taxes, price controls, 35 to 50 new bureaucracies that cost $1.5 trillion. Don\u2019t forget that, that happened in 1993. A tax increase, a tax on everybody in America. Not just the rich. If you made 25,000 as the original proposal, you got your Social Security taxes increased. We had a BTU tax we turned into a $35 million gas tax, a $265 billion tax increase."}
{"Title":"October 6, 1996 Debate Transcript","Debate":"The First Clinton-Dole Presidential Debate","Date":"October 6, 1996","Participants":"Clinton-Dole","Moderators":"LEHRER","Speaker":"DOLE","Text":"I guess I rely more on the individual. I carry a little card in my pocket called the Tenth Amendment. Where possible, I want to give power back to the states and back to the people. That\u2019s my difference with the President. We\u2019ll have specific differences later. He noted a few, but there are others."}

{"Title":"October 6, 1996 Debate Transcript","Debate":"The First Clinton-Dole Presidential Debate","Date":"October 6, 1996","Participants":"Clinton-Dole","Moderators":"LEHRER","Speaker":"CLINTON","Text":"I trust the people. We\u2019ve done a lot to give the people more powers to make their own decisions over their own lives. But I do think we are right when we try to, for example, give mothers and newborns 48 hours before they can be kicked out of the hospital, ending these drive-by deliveries."}
{"Title":"October 6, 1996 Debate Transcript","Debate":"The First Clinton-Dole Presidential Debate","Date":"October 6, 1996","Participants":"Clinton-Dole","Moderators":"LEHRER","Speaker":"CLINTON","Text":"I think we were right to pass the Kassebaum-Kennedy bill, which says you can\u2019t lose your health insurance just because you change jobs or because someone in your family\u2019s been sick. Our government is smaller and less bureaucratic and has given more authority to the states than its two predecessors under Republican presidents. But I do believe we have to help our people get ready to succeed in the 21st Century."}
{"Title":"October 6, 1996 Debate Transcript","Debate":"The First Clinton-Dole Presidential Debate","Date":"October 6, 1996","Participants":"Clinton-Dole","Moderators":"LEHRER","Speaker":"LEHRER","Text":"Senator Dole, the President said in his opening statement we are better off today than we were four years ago. Do you agree?"}
{"Title":"October 6, 1996 Debate Transcript","Debate":"The First Clinton-Dole Presidential Debate","Date":"October 6, 1996","Participants":"Clinton-Dole","Moderators":"LEHRER","Speaker":"DOLE","Text":"Well, he\u2019s better off than he was four years ago."}
{"Title":"October 6, 1996 Debate Transcript","Debate":"The First Clinton-Dole Presidential Debate","Date":"October 6, 1996","Participants":"Clinton-Dole","Moderators":"LEHRER","Speaker":"CLINTON","Text":"I agree with that. That\u2019s right."}
{"Title":"October 6, 1996 Debate Transcript","Debate":"The First Clinton-Dole Presidential Debate","Date":"October 6, 1996","Participants":"Clinton-Dole","Moderators":"LEHRER","Speaker":"DOLE","Text":"And I may be better off four years from now, but I don\u2019t know. I looked at the slowest growth in the century. He inherited a growth of 4.7 4.8 percent, now it\u2019s down to about 2.4 percent. We\u2019re going to pass a million bankruptcies this year for the first time in history. We\u2019ve got stagnant wages. In fact, women\u2019s wages have dropped 2.2 percent. Men\u2019s wages haven\u2019t gone up, gone down. So we have stagnation."}
{"Title":"October 6, 1996 Debate Transcript","Debate":"The First Clinton-Dole Presidential Debate","Date":"October 6, 1996","Participants":"Clinton-Dole","Moderators":"LEHRER","Speaker":"DOLE","Text":"We have the highest foreign debt in history. And it seems to me that if you take a look, are you better off? Well, I guess some may be better off. Saddam Hussein is probably better off than he was four years ago. Renee Proval (ph) is probably better off than he was four years ago. But are the American people? They\u2019re working harder and higher and harder paying more taxes. For the first time in history, you pay about 40 percent of what you earn. More than you spend for food, clothing and shelter combined for taxes under this administration. So some may be better off."}
{"Title":"October 6, 1996 Debate Transcript","Debate":"The First Clinton-Dole Presidential Debate","Date":"October 6, 1996","Participants":"Clinton-Dole","Moderators":"LEHRER","Speaker":"DOLE","Text":"They talk about family income being up. That\u2019s not true in Connecticut, family income is down. And it\u2019s up in some cases because both parents are working. One works for the family, and one works to pay taxes for the government. We\u2019re going to give them tax cuts so they can spend more time with their children, maybe even take a vacation. That\u2019s what America is all about."}
{"Title":"October 6, 1996 Debate Transcript","Debate":"The First Clinton-Dole Presidential Debate","Date":"October 6, 1996","Participants":"Clinton-Dole","Moderators":"LEHRER","Speaker":"LEHRER","Text":"One minute, Mr. President."}
{"Title":"October 6, 1996 Debate Transcript","Debate":"The First Clinton-Dole Presidential Debate","Date":"October 6, 1996","Participants":"Clinton-Dole","Moderators":"LEHRER","Speaker":"CLINTON","Text":"Well, let me say, first of all, in February Senator Dole acknowledged that the American economy was in the best shape it\u2019s been in in 30 years. We have ten and a half million more jobs, a faster job growth rate than under any Republican administration since the 1920s. Wages are goings up for the first time in a decade. We have record numbers of new small businesses. We have the biggest drop in the number of people in poverty in 27 years. All groups of people are growing. We had the biggest drop in income inequality in 27 years in 1995."}
{"Title":"October 6, 1996 Debate Transcript","Debate":"The First Clinton-Dole Presidential Debate","Date":"October 6, 1996","Participants":"Clinton-Dole","Moderators":"LEHRER","Speaker":"CLINTON","Text":"The average family\u2019s income has gone up over $1600 just since our economic plan passed. So I think it\u2019s clear that we\u2019re better off than we were four years ago. Now we need to focus on what do we need to do to be better off still. How can we help people as we are to get their retirements when they work for small businesses, to be able to afford health insurance, to be able to educate their children. That\u2019s what I want to focus on. But we are clearly better off than we were four years ago, as Senator Dole acknowledged this year."}
{"Title":"October 6, 1996 Debate Transcript","Debate":"The First Clinton-Dole Presidential Debate","Date":"October 6, 1996","Participants":"Clinton-Dole","Moderators":"LEHRER","Speaker":"LEHRER","Text":"Senator Dole."}
{"Title":"October 6, 1996 Debate Transcript","Debate":"The First Clinton-Dole Presidential Debate","Date":"October 6, 1996","Participants":"Clinton-Dole","Moderators":"LEHRER","Speaker":"DOLE","Text":"I doubt that I acknowledged that this year. But in any event, I think we just look at the facts. We ask the people that are viewing tonight, are you better off than you were four years ago. It\u2019s not whether we\u2019re better off, it\u2019s whether they\u2019re better off."}
{"Title":"October 6, 1996 Debate Transcript","Debate":"The First Clinton-Dole Presidential Debate","Date":"October 6, 1996","Participants":"Clinton-Dole","Moderators":"LEHRER","Speaker":"DOLE","Text":"Are you working harder to put food on the table, feed your children. Are your children getting a better education. Drug use has doubled the past 44 months all across America. Crime has gone down but it\u2019s because the mayors like Rudy Giuliani where one third of the drop happened in one city, New York City."}
{"Title":"October 6, 1996 Debate Transcript","Debate":"The First Clinton-Dole Presidential Debate","Date":"October 6, 1996","Participants":"Clinton-Dole","Moderators":"LEHRER","Speaker":"DOLE","Text":"So, yes, some may be better off. But of the people listening tonight, the working families who will benefit from economic packages, they\u2019ll be better off when Bob Dole is president and Jack Kemp is vice president."}
{"Title":"October 6, 1996 Debate Transcript","Debate":"The First Clinton-Dole Presidential Debate","Date":"October 6, 1996","Participants":"Clinton-Dole","Moderators":"LEHRER","Speaker":"LEHRER","Text":"Mr. President, Senator Dole has come pretty close in the last few days to accusing you of lying about his position on Medicare reform. Have you done so?"}
{"Title":"October 6, 1996 Debate Transcript","Debate":"The First Clinton-Dole Presidential Debate","Date":"October 6, 1996","Participants":"Clinton-Dole","Moderators":"LEHRER","Speaker":"CLINTON","Text":"Absolutely not. Let\u2019s look at the position. First of all, remember that in this campaign season, since Senator Dole\u2019s been a candidate, he has bragged about the fact that he voted against Medicare in the beginning, in 1965, one of only 12 members. He said he did the right thing then, he knew it wouldn\u2019t work at the time. That\u2019s what he said."}
{"Title":"October 6, 1996 Debate Transcript","Debate":"The First Clinton-Dole Presidential Debate","Date":"October 6, 1996","Participants":"Clinton-Dole","Moderators":"LEHRER","Speaker":"CLINTON","Text":"Then his budget that he passed along with Speaker Gingrich cut Medicare $270 billion, more than was necessary to repair the Medicare trust fund. It would have charged seniors more for out-of-pocket costs as well as more in premiums because doctors could have charged them more. The American Medical, Hospital Association, the Nurses Association, the Catholic Hospital Association all said hundreds of hospitals could close and people would be hurt badly under the Dole-Gingrich Medicare plan that I vetoed."}
{"Title":"October 6, 1996 Debate Transcript","Debate":"The First Clinton-Dole Presidential Debate","Date":"October 6, 1996","Participants":"Clinton-Dole","Moderators":"LEHRER","Speaker":"CLINTON","Text":"And now with this risky $550 billion tax scheme of Senator Dole\u2019s, even his own friends, his campaign co-chair, Senator D\u2019Amato, says that they can\u2019t possibly pay for it without cutting Medicare more and cutting Social Security as well, according to him."}
{"Title":"October 6, 1996 Debate Transcript","Debate":"The First Clinton-Dole Presidential Debate","Date":"October 6, 1996","Participants":"Clinton-Dole","Moderators":"LEHRER","Speaker":"CLINTON","Text":"Now, my balanced budget plan adds ten years to the life of the Medicare trust fund, ten years. And we\u2019ll have time to deal with the long-term problems of the baby boomers. But it was simply wrong to finance their last scheme to cut Medicare $270 billion to run the risk of it withering on the vine. We always had to reform it over the years, but we need somebody who believes it in to reform it."}
{"Title":"October 6, 1996 Debate Transcript","Debate":"The First Clinton-Dole Presidential Debate","Date":"October 6, 1996","Participants":"Clinton-Dole","Moderators":"LEHRER","Speaker":"LEHRER","Text":"Senator Dole."}
{"Title":"October 6, 1996 Debate Transcript","Debate":"The First Clinton-Dole Presidential Debate","Date":"October 6, 1996","Participants":"Clinton-Dole","Moderators":"LEHRER","Speaker":"DOLE","Text":"Well, I must say, I look back at the vote on Medicare in 1965, we had a program called Eldercare that also provided drugs and means tests to people who needed medical attention received it. I thought it was a good program. But I\u2019ve supported Medicare ever since."}
{"Title":"October 6, 1996 Debate Transcript","Debate":"The First Clinton-Dole Presidential Debate","Date":"October 6, 1996","Participants":"Clinton-Dole","Moderators":"LEHRER","Speaker":"DOLE","Text":"In fact, I used to go home, my mother would tell me, Bob, all I\u2019ve got is my Social Security and my Medicare, don\u2019t cut it. I wouldn\u2019t violate anything my mother said. In fact, we had a conversation about our mothers one day, a very poignant conversation in the White House. I\u2019m concerned about healthcare. I\u2019ve had the best healthcare from government hospitals, Army hospitals and I know its importance, but we\u2019ve got to fix it. It\u2019s his trustees, the President\u2019s trustees, not mine, who says it\u2019s going to go broke. He doesn\u2019t fix it for ten years. We ought to appoint a commission, just as we did in Social Security in 1983, when we rescued Social Security, and I was proud to be on that commission, along with Claude Pepper, the champion of senior citizens from Florida. And we can do it again, if we take politics out of it. Stop scaring the seniors, Mr. President. You\u2019ve already spent $45 million scaring seniors and tearing me apart. I think it\u2019s time to have a truce."}

{"Title":"October 6, 1996 Debate Transcript","Debate":"The First Clinton-Dole Presidential Debate","Date":"October 6, 1996","Participants":"Clinton-Dole","Moderators":"LEHRER","Speaker":"CLINTON","Text":"Well, let me say, first of all, I\u2019d be happy to have a commission deal with this and I appreciate what Senator Dole did on the \u201983 Social Security commission. But it won\u2019t be possible to do, if his tax scheme passes because even his own campaign co-chair, Senator D\u2019Amato, says he\u2019ll have to cut Medicare even more than was cut in the bill that I vetoed. I vetoed that bill because it cut more Medicare and and basically ran the risk of breaking up the system. My balanced budget plan puts ten years on the Medicare. We ought to do that, then we can have a commission. But Senator Dole\u2019s plans are not good for the country."}

{"Title":"October 6, 1996 Debate Transcript","Debate":"The First Clinton-Dole Presidential Debate","Date":"October 6, 1996","Participants":"Clinton-Dole","Moderators":"LEHRER","Speaker":"DOLE","Text":"Well, the people need it, that\u2019s the point. This is not a Wall Street tax cut. This is a family tax cut. This is a Main Street tax cut, 15 percent across \u2014 let\u2019s take a family making $30,000 a year, that\u2019s $1261. Now, maybe to some in this Bushnell Memorial that it\u2019s not a lot of money, but people watching tonight with a couple of kids, a working family, that\u2019s four or five months of day care, maybe a personal computer; it\u2019s may be three or four months of mortgage payments. This economic package is about families but it\u2019s a six-point package. First of all, it\u2019s a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution which President Clinton defeated. He twisted arms and got six Democrats to vote the other way, but we lost by one vote. It\u2019s balancing a budget by the year 2002. It\u2019s a tax cut, cutting capital gains 50 percent. So you can go out and create more jobs and more opportunities. It\u2019s a state tax relief. It\u2019s a $500 per child tax credit. It\u2019s about litigation reforms."}
{"Title":"October 6, 1996 Debate Transcript","Debate":"The First Clinton-Dole Presidential Debate","Date":"October 6, 1996","Participants":"Clinton-Dole","Moderators":"LEHRER","Speaker":"DOLE","Text":"Now that the President gets millions of dollars from the trial lawyers, he probably doesn\u2019t like this provision. In fact, when I fell off the podium in Chico, before I lit the ground, hit the ground I had call on my cell phone from a trial lawyer saying I think we\u2019ve got a case here.

It\u2019s a $550 billion tax scheme that will cause a big hole in the deficit which will raise interest rates and slow down the economy and cause people to pay more for home mortgages, car payments, credit card payments, college loans, and small business loans. It\u2019s not good to raise the deficit. We worked too hard to lower it. It will actually raise taxes on nine million people and, in addition to that, it will force bigger cuts in Medicare, Medicaid, education and the environment than the ones that he and Mr. Gingrich passed that I vetoed last year. So it sounds great, but our targeted tax cut for education, child rearing, healthcare and home buying, which is paid for in my balanced budget plan, something that he has not done, certified by the Congressional budget office, that\u2019s the right way to go."}

The drunk driver had no money. Under the new bill, if I had signed it, a person like that could never have had any recovery. I thought that was wrong. So I gave four or five specific examples to the Congress and said, prove to me that these people could recover but we\u2019re going to eliminate frivolous lawsuits, I\u2019ll sign the bill. But generally I believe that a president has to be willing to do what he thinks is right. I\u2019ve done a lot of things that were controversial. My economic plan, my trade position, Bosnia, Haiti, taking on the NRA for the first time, taking on the tobacco companies for the first time. Sometimes you just have to do that because you know it\u2019s right for the country over the long run.

Now, if these aren\u2019t special interests, I\u2019ve got a lot to learn. I was there for a while before I left on June the 11th. The trial lawyers and I don\u2019t \u2014 you know, my wife\u2019s a lawyer. We\u2019re the only two lawyers in Washington that trust each other. But we\u2019re lawyers, I like lawyers.

You\u2019re putting a lot of business people out of business. Small businessmen and businesswomen who paid 70 percent of your ninteen , your$265 billion tax increase, the largest tax increase in the history of America. I said that one day and Pat Moynihan, a Democrat, say, no, he said, in the history of the world. So I modified it, the largest tax increase in the history of the world.

Whatever it is, whatever the checklist was in \u201992, it\u2019s all done with campaign finance reform. I worked with Senator Mitchell, who played me, I guess, in the debate warmup.

But let me respond to what you said. I agree that too many incumbent politicians in Washington in both parties have consistently opposed campaign finance reform. That was certainly the case from the minute I got there. So after Speaker Gingrich and Senator Dole took over the Congress, I went to New Hampshire and a man suggested \u2014 a gentleman that unfortunately just passed away a couple of days ago, suggested that we appoint a commission. And I shook hands with him on it and I appointed my members, and the commission never met. And then Senator Dole\u2019s ardent supporters, Senator McCain, who\u2019s out there today, along with Senator Feingold, supported, sponsored a campaign finance reform proposal. I strongly supported it. And members of Senator Dole\u2019s own party in the Senate killed it. And he was not out there urging them to vote for the McCain-Feingold bill. So I think the American people, including the Perot supporters, know that I have had a consistent record in favor of campaign finance reform, and I will continue to have. And I hope we can finally get it in the next session of Congress, because we need it badly."}

{"Title":"October 6, 1996 Debate Transcript","Debate":"The First Clinton-Dole Presidential Debate","Date":"October 6, 1996","Participants":"Clinton-Dole","Moderators":"LEHRER","Speaker":"CLINTON","Text":"Well, Jim, I think every American in any position of responsibility should be concerned about what\u2019s happened. I am. But let\u2019s look at the overall record. Overall in America cocaine use has dropped 30 percent in the last four years, casual drug use down 13 percent. The tragedy is that our young people are still increasing their use of drugs up to about 11 percent total with marijuana, and I regret it. Let me tell you what I tried to do about it. I appointed a four-star general who led our efforts south of the border to keep drugs from coming into the country as our nation\u2019s drug czar. The most heavily directed, decorated solder in uniform when he retired. We submitted the biggest drug budget ever. We have dramatically increased control and enforcement at the border. We supported a a crime bill that had 60 death penalties including, including the death penalty for drug kingpins. And I supported a big expansion in safe and drug-free schools program to support things like the DARE program because I thought all those things were very important. Do I think that I bear some responsibility for the fact that too many of our children still don\u2019t understand drugs are wrong, drugs can kill you. Even though I have consistently opposed the legalization of drugs all my public life and worked hard against them. I think we all do. And I hope we can do better. I don\u2019t think this issue should be politicized because my record is clear and I don\u2019t think Senator Dole supports using using drugs. I think we just have to continue to work on this until those who think it isn\u2019t dangerous and won\u2019t kill them and won\u2019t destroy their lives, get the message and change."}

I mean, you say we\u2019ve done all these bad things, which isn\u2019t the case. But it seems to me the record is clear. The record is pretty clear in Arkansas, when you were governor. Drug use doubled. You resisted the appointment of a drug czar there because you thought it might interfere with treatment. But here you cut the drug czar\u2019s office 83 percent. You cut interdiction substantially. I mean that\u2019s what, I want to stop it from coming across the border. And in my administration, we\u2019re going to train the National Guard to stop it from coming across the border. This is a invasion of drugs from all over the world. And we have a responsibility. You had a surgeon \u2014 or before General McCaffrey (ph) you had a lady who said we ought to consider legalizing drugs. Is that the kind of leadership we need? And I won\u2019t comment on other things that happened in your administration or your past about drugs.

They didn\u2019t have the weapons, they didn\u2019t have the tanks. They asked for the tanks. They didn\u2019t get the tanks from this administration because we were nation building. It\u2019s called mission creep. We turn it over to the United Nations. The President didn\u2019t have much to do about it. You look at Haiti, where we spend about three billion dollars and we got an alarm call there about two weeks ago. You got to send down some more people, because the president\u2019s found out there are death squads on his on his, in his own property. So we need more protection from America. Bosnia, Northern Ireland. There\u2019s no ceasefire in Bosnia. I think there are still lot of problems in Bosnia. We agreed to train and arm the Muslims so they could defend themselves, the policy you had when you ran in 1992. We haven\u2019t done that. We\u2019re way behind, which means Americans can\u2019t come home. Americans shouldn\u2019t have gone there in the first place, had we let them defend themselves, as they have a right to do under Article 57 of the United Nations charter."}

You know, the President said he was going to cut defense $60 billion, he cut defense $112 billion. Devastated states like California and others. And I think now we\u2019ve got a problem. We\u2019ve got to go back and look. It\u2019s just like you said in Texas one day, you know raised taxes too much, and you did, and you cut defense too much, Mr. President, and you did.

Incentives. We don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen. Here we have Cuba 90 miles from our shores, and what have we done, we passed the law that gave people a right to sue and the President postponed it for six months.

{"Title":"October 6, 1996 Debate Transcript","Debate":"The First Clinton-Dole Presidential Debate","Date":"October 6, 1996","Participants":"Clinton-Dole","Moderators":"LEHRER","Speaker":"CLINTON","Text":"Well, first of all, for the last four years we have worked had to put more and more pressure on the Castro government to bring about more openness and move toward democracy. In 1992, before I became President, the Congress passed the Cuba Democracy Act and I enforced it vigorously. We made the embargo tougher but we increased contacts people to people with the Cubans, including direct telephone service, which was largely supported by the Cuban-American community. Then Cuba shot down two of our planes and murdered four people in international air space. They were completely beyond the pale of the law, and I signed the Helms-Burton legislation. Senator Dole is correct. I did give about six months before the effective date of the act before lawsuits can actually be filed, even though they\u2019re effective now, and can be legally binding, because I want to change Cuba. And the United States needs help from other countries."}

This is a serious business. It\u2019s about your family; it\u2019s about your business, and in this case it\u2019s about a firmer policy with Cuba."}
{"Title":"October 6, 1996 Debate Transcript","Debate":"The First Clinton-Dole Presidential Debate","Date":"October 6, 1996","Participants":"Clinton-Dole","Moderators":"LEHRER","Speaker":"CLINTON","Text":"There were several off-the-subject quaffers in that litany. Let me just mention, Senator Dole voted for $900 billion in tax increases. His running mate Jack Kemp once said that Bob Dole never met a tax he didn\u2019t hike. And everybody knows, including the Wall Street Journal, hardly a friend of the Democratic party of this administration, that the \u201982 tax increase he sponsored in inflation-adjusted dollars was the biggest tax increase in American history. So we ought to at least get the facts out here on the table so we can know where to go from here."}

We were closing loopholes, we were going after big corporations. I know you probably would oppose it, Mr. President, but I think we should have a fairer system and a flatter system, and we\u2019ll have a fairer and flatter system and we\u2019re going to make the economic package work. Healthcare. Well, we finally passed the Kassebaum bill. The President was opposed to it in 1993. He wanted to give us this big system, that took over about one-seventh of the economy, that put on price controls, created all these state alliances, and would cost $1.5 trillion and force people into managed care, whether they wanted it or not. Most people want to see their own doctor. They\u2019re going to see their own doctor when Bob Dole is president. We won\u2019t threaten anybody."}
{"Title":"October 6, 1996 Debate Transcript","Debate":"The First Clinton-Dole Presidential Debate","Date":"October 6, 1996","Participants":"Clinton-Dole","Moderators":"LEHRER","Speaker":"DOLE","Text":"So we passed the Kassebaum-Kennedy, the Kennedy Kassebaum bill that will cover about 20 to 25 million people. We\u2019ve been for that for four, five, six years. The President held it up. And even when it finally got near passage, Senator Kennedy held it up for 100 days, because he wasn\u2019t satisfied with one provision. But it will cover preexisting conditions. If you change your job, you\u2019re going to be covered. So there are a lot of good things in this bill we should have done instead of trying this massive, massive takeover by the Federal government. But then of course we had a Democratic Congress and they didn\u2019t want to do that. Until we got a Republican Congress, we finally got action, I\u2019m proud of my colleagues in the Republican Party for getting that done. It means a lot to a lot of people watching us tonight."}
{"Title":"October 6, 1996 Debate Transcript","Debate":"The First Clinton-Dole Presidential Debate","Date":"October 6, 1996","Participants":"Clinton-Dole","Moderators":"LEHRER","Speaker":"CLINTON","Text":"Well, that sounds very good, but it\u2019s very wrong. Senator Dole remembers well that we actually offered not to even put in a healthcare bill in 1994, uh \u201993, but instead to work with the Senate Republicans and write a joint bill. And they said no because they got a memo from one of their political advisers saying that instead they should characterize whatever we did as big government and make sure nothing was done to aid healthcare before the \u201994 elections so they could make that claim. Well, maybe we bit off more than we could chew, but we\u2019re pursuing a step-by-step reform now. The Kennedy-Kassebaum bill that I signed will make it possible for 25 million people to keep their health insurance when they change jobs or when somebody in their family\u2019s been sick. I signed a bill to stop these drive-by deliveries when insurance companies can force people out of the hospital after 24 hours and I vetoed Senator Dole\u2019s Medicare plan that would have forced a lot of seniors into managed care and taken a lot more money out of their pockets and led to Medicare withering on the vine."}
{"Title":"October 6, 1996 Debate Transcript","Debate":"The First Clinton-Dole Presidential Debate","Date":"October 6, 1996","Participants":"Clinton-Dole","Moderators":"LEHRER","Speaker":"DOLE","Text":"Well, many of the provisions in the Kassebaum bill were provisions that \u2014 my provisions, like deductions for long-term care, making certain that self-employed people that are watching tonight can deduct not 30 percent but 80 percent of you pay for premiums. You can also deduct long-term care now, so it\u2019s a good it\u2019s a good start. I think there\u2019s enough \u2014 we\u2019re even looking at our tax cut proposal, our economic package. There may be a way of reaching out to the uninsured, because there are a lot of uninsured people in the country, particularly children, that should be covered. Another way you can do is to expand Medicaid. In America no one will go without healthcare, no one will go without food."}

Saddam Hussein is under a U.N. resolution not to threaten his neighbors or threaten his own, repress his own citizens. Unfortunately, a lot of people, have never been as concerned about the Kurds as the United States has tried to be, and we\u2019ve been flying an operation to protect them out of Turkey for many years now. What happened was one of the Turkish, one of the Kurdish leaders invited him to go up north, but we felt since the whole world community had told him not to do it, that once he did it we had to do something. We did not feel that I could commit. I certainly didn\u2019t feel I should commit American troops to throw him out of where he had gone, and that was the only way to do that. So the appropriate thing strategically to do was to reduce his ability to threaten his neighbors. We did that by expanding what\u2019s called the no-fly zone by increasing our allies\u2019 control of the air space now from the Kuwait border to the suburbs of Baghdad. Was it the right thing to do? I believe it was. Is it fully effective? Did it make him withdraw from the north? Well, he does , he has a little bit, and I hope he will continue. We have learned that you give him an inch he\u2019ll take a mile. We had to do something, and even though not all of our allies supported it at first, I think most of them now believe that what we did was an appropriate thing to do."}

Now we\u2019ve got all thousands and thousands of refugees. We\u2019re even shipping 3,000 Kurds to Guam. It involves Turkey. It\u2019s a real problem. Saddam is probably about as strong as he ever was. We shot, what, 44 cruise missiles, worth about a million-two a piece, and hit some radar, that repaired in a couple, three days. Did we inflict any damage? No. Did we have any allies helping? Well, we have Great Britain. They\u2019re always very loyal to us, and I appreciate that. And of course Kuwait. Even though they had to find out they had 5,000 troops coming, they didn\u2019t even understand that. We had to get their permission. The bottom line is, we went in there alone.

And I think I know what he meant by that. He\u2019s troubled, as I am, by some of the things that go on today. But I believe America is the greatest country in human history because we have maintained freedom and increasing prosperity by relentlessly pushing the barriers of knowledge, the barriers of the present, always moving into the future. That\u2019s why when I became President I was determined to kind of move beyond this whole stale debate that had gone on in Washington for too long to get this country moving again. And that\u2019s why we\u2019ve got a country with ten and a half million more jobs, and record numbers of new businesses, and rising incomes, and falling crime rates, and welfare roll rates. That\u2019s why we\u2019re moving in the right direction. And I\u2019m trying to emphasize that what I want to do is to continue to do that. That\u2019s why my balanced budget plan will still invest and grow this economy. That\u2019s why I want a tax cut for education and child rearing, but it\u2019s got to be paid for. That\u2019s why I want to continue the work we have done over partisan opposition, to work with communities to bring that crime rate down until our streets are all safe again. These are my commitments. I am very oriented toward the future. I think this election has to be geared toward the future. I think America\u2019s best days are still ahead, but we\u2019ve got to build the right bridge."}

And you pick out 20,000, whether they need the money or not, and they get paid for volunteering. I like young people. I like teachers. I\u2019m a product of a public school. You attended a private school for some time in your life. I like teachers. You\u2019re not for school choice, you can\u2019t be for school choice, because this is that special interest money again. When you get 99.5 percent of the money, we don\u2019t know what happened to the other .5 percent, we\u2019re looking for it, somebody got it, but it all went to Democrats.

Now that\u2019s not reform, Mr. President. Why can\u2019t Landale Shakespeare in Cleveland or Pilar Gonzales in Milwaukee give their children an opportunity to go to a better school. Some schools aren\u2019t safe. Some schools aren\u2019t even safe. Your choice is nothing.

You, it\u2019s amazing to me, you are all for having more responsibility at the local level for everything except schools. Where we don\u2019t have very much money at the Federal level to spend on education, we ought to spend it helping the 90 percent of the kids that we can help. If a local school district in Cleveland or anyplace else wants to have a private choice plan like Milwaukee did, let them have at it. I might say the results are highly ambiguous. But I want to get out there and give a better education opportunity to all of our children and that\u2019s why I vetoed the budget you passed with $30 billion in education cuts.

It cut funds to clean up toxic waste dumps with 10 million of our kids still living within four miles of a toxic waste dump, by a third. It ended the principle that the polluters should pay for those toxic waste dumps unless it was very recent. Their budget weakened our support for education. $30 billion, even cut funds for scholarships and college loans. Their budget cut $270 billion in Medicare and, finally, their budget withdrew the national guarantee of healthcare to poor children, families with children with handicaps, the elderly in nursing homes, poor pregnant women.

I\u2019ve just finished reading a book, I think it\u2019s called \u2014 what is it called, what is it, The Demise of the Democratic Party by Ronald Cardash (ph) or something talking about all the liberal influences in the administration.

The bottom line is this: I think the American people, thought he\u2019d recite all these bills and all these things, they want to know what\u2019s going to happen to them. They\u2019ve all got a lot of anxieties out there. Did anybody complain when you raised taxes? Did anybody go out and ask the people, how are you going to pay the extra money? That\u2019s why we want an economic package. We want the government to pinch their pennies for a change instead of the people pinching their pennies.

You\u2019ve got one parent working for the government, the other parent working for the family. This is important business. This is about getting the economy moving again. This is about American jobs and opportunities. It\u2019s about the government, as I said before, pinching its pennies for a change instead of the poor taxpayer.

As far as I\u2019m concerned, this is a campaign about issues. It\u2019s about my vision for America and about his liberal vision for America. And not about personal things. You know, I think his liberal vision is a thing of the past. I know he wants to disown it. I wouldn\u2019t want to be a liberal either, Mr. President, but you\u2019re stuck with it because that\u2019s your record, that\u2019s your record in Arkansas: The biggest tax increase in history. The biggest crime increase in history, the biggest drug increase in history in Arkansas."}

I think a targeted tax cut is better for our future, targeted to education and child rearing, with the rest of the education plan, hooking up all of our classrooms to the Internet by the year 2000. Making sure we\u2019ve got an army of reading volunteers, trained people to teach with parents and teachers so that our eight year olds can learn to read. Investing in our environment. Cleaning up two-thirds of the worst toxic waste dumps. Those plans are better than this $550 billion tax scheme."}

Everybody who\u2019s looked at it, 500 economists, seven Nobel prize winners, say it\u2019s bad for the economy. It\u2019s going to blow a hole in the deficit It\u2019s going to raise taxes on nine million people and require bigger cuts than the one I vetoed.

You didn\u2019t even have tax cuts in your budget, Mr. President, the first two years you were president. It wasn\u2019t until we had a Republican Congress you even thought about, you talked about tax cuts. Getting back to personal differences, I think, Jim, if you are a little more specific, but I think the President could clarify one thing tonight and that\u2019s the question of pardons. I know you talked about it on the Jim, with Jim Lehrer on the PBS show. And I\u2019ve never discussed Whitewater, as I\u2019ve told you personally. I\u2019m not discussing Whitewater now.

He\u2019s arranged for me to spend a lot more time with Senator D\u2019Amato in the last couple years so I\u2019m more familiar with his comments than I used to be. Let me say what I\u2019ve said already about this pardon issue. This is an issue they\u2019ve brought up. It\u2019s under, there\u2019s been no consideration of it, no discussion of it. I will tell you this: I will not give anyone special treatment and I will strictly adhere to the law.

If there are other specific areas, but beyond that I haven\u2019t gotten into any of these things, as the President knows. We\u2019ve had that discussion. And again I know Senator D\u2019Amato I think may have had a hearing or two on Whitewater, I can\u2019t remember, but he\u2019s not my general chairman, he\u2019s a friend of mine.

And I think I have my strengths and I think the best thing going for Bob Dole is that Bob Dole keeps his word.

I said that our economic plan would produce eight million jobs, we have ten and a half million new jobs. We\u2019re number one in autos again, record numbers of new small businesses. I said we\u2019d put, pass a crime bill that would put 100,000 police on the street, ban assault weapons, and deal with the problems that ought to be dealt with with capital punishment, including capital punishment for drug kingpins, and we did that."}

We still gave tax cuts to 15 million working Americans, and now I\u2019ve got a plan that\u2019s been out there for two years, it could have been passed already, but instead the Republicans shut the government down to try to force their budget and their plan on me, and I couldn\u2019t take that. But we\u2019ll get the rest of that tax relief.

He came in with a high growth rate, the 1990 budget agreement, which some, you know, didn\u2019t like, had some very tough cost controls, put a lot of pressure on Congress. The S & L crisis was over, they\u2019re starting to sell assets, all that money was coming in. And he cut defense an extra $60 billion, threw a lot of people out of work."}

I\u2019d like to leave you with the thought that the things I do as president are basically driven by the people whose lives I have seen affected by what does or doesn\u2019t happen in this country. The auto worker in Toledo who was unemployed when I was elected and now has a great job because we\u2019re number one in auto production again. All the people I\u2019ve met who used to be on welfare who are now working and raising their children. And I think what others could do for our country and themselves if we did the welfare reform thing in the proper way. I think of the man who grabbed me by the shoulder once with tears in his eyes and said his daughter was dying of cancer and he thanked me for giving him a chance to spend some time with her without losing his job because of the Family and Medical Leave Act. I think of all the people I grew up with and went to school with and who I stay in touch with and who nerve let me forget how what we do in Washington affects all of you out there in America. Folks, we can build that bridge to the 21st Century, big enough and strong enough for all of us to walk across, and I hope you will help me build it."}
