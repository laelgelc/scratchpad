Our jobs are fleeing the country. They\u2019re going to Mexico. They\u2019re going to many other countries. You look at what China is doing to our country in terms of making our product. They\u2019re devaluing their currency, and there\u2019s nobody in our government to fight them. And we have a very good fight. And we have a winning fight.

When you look at what\u2019s happening in Mexico, a friend of mine who builds plants said it\u2019s the eighth wonder of the world. They\u2019re building some of the biggest plants anywhere in the world, some of the most sophisticated, some of the best plants. With the United States, as he said, not so much."}

You see that, their small car division leaving. Thousands of jobs leaving Michigan, leaving Ohio. They\u2019re all leaving. And we can\u2019t allow it to happen anymore. As far as child care is concerned and so many other things, I think Hillary and I agree on that. We probably disagree a little bit as to numbers and amounts and what we\u2019re going to do, but perhaps we\u2019ll be talking about that later."}

Under my plan, I\u2019ll be reducing taxes tremendously, from 35 percent to 15 percent for companies, small and big businesses.

I understand that. You know, Donald was very fortunate in his life, and that\u2019s all to his benefit. He started his business with $14 million, borrowed from his father, and he really believes that the more you help wealthy people, the better off we\u2019ll be and that everything will work out from there."}

You\u2019ve talked about creating 25 million jobs, and you\u2019ve promised to bring back millions of jobs for Americans.
