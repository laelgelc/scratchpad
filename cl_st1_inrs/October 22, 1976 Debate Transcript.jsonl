WALTERS","Text":"Good evening, I\u2019m Barbara Walters, moderator of the last of the debates of 1976 between Gerald R. Ford, Republican candidate for president, and Jimmy Carter, Democratic candidate for president. Welcome, President Ford. Welcome, Governor Carter. And thank you for joining us this evening. This debate takes place before an audience in Phi Beta Kappa Memorial Hall on the campus of the College of William and Mary in historic Williamsburg, Virginia. It is particularly appropriate that in this Bicentennial year we meet on these grounds to hear this debate. Two hundred years ago, five William and Mary students met at nearby Raleigh Tavern to form Phi Beta Kappa, a fraternity designed, they wrote, to search out and dispel the clouds of falsehood by debating without reserve the issues of the day. In that spirit of debate, without reserve, to dispel the clouds of falsehood, gentlemen, let us proceed. The subject matter of this debate is open, covering all issues and topics. Our questioners tonight are Joseph Kraft, syndicated columnist; Robert Maynard, editorial writer for the Washington Post; and Jack Nelson, Washington bureau chief of the Los Angeles Times. The ground rules tonight are as follows: Questioners will alternate questions between the candidates. The candidate has up to two and one-half minutes to answer the question. The other candidate has up to two minutes to respond. If necessary, a questioner may ask a follow-up question for further clarification, and in that case the candidate has up to two minutes to respond. As was initially agreed to by both candidates, the answers should be responsive to the particular questions. Finally, each candidate has up to three minutes for a closing statement. President Ford and Governor Carter do not have prepared notes or comments with them this evening, but they may make notes and refer to them during the debate. It has been determined that President Ford would take the first question in this last debate, and Mr. Kraft, you have that first question for President Ford."}

KRAFT","Text":"Mr. President, uh \u2013 I assume that the Americans all know that these are difficult times and that there\u2019s no \u201cpie in the sky\u201d and that they don\u2019t expect something for nothing. Uh \u2013 so, I\u2019d like to ask you as a first question as you look ahead in the next four years, what sacrifices are you going to call on the American people to make, what price are you going to ask them to pay uh \u2013 to realize your objectives? Uh \u2013 let me add, uh \u2013 Governor Carter, that if \u2013 if you felt uh \u2013 that it was appropriate to answer that question in \u2013 in your comments uh \u2013 as to what price it would be appropriate for the American pay \u2013 people to pay uh \u2013 for a Carter administration, I think that would be proper too. Mr. President?"}

FORD","Text":"Mr. Kraft, I believe that the American people, in the next four years under a Ford administration, will be called upon to make those necessary sacrifices to preserve the peace which we have. Which means, of course, that uh \u2013 we will have to maintain an adequate military capability \u2013 which means, of course, that we will have to add a uh \u2013 I think uh \u2013 a few billion dollars to our defense appropriations to make certain that we have adequate uh -strategic forces \u2013 adequate conventional forces. I think the American people will be called upon to uh \u2013 uh \u2013 be in the forefront in giving leadership to the solution of those problems that must be solved in the Middle East, in southern Africa, and any problems that might arise in the Pacific. The American people will be called upon to tighten their belts a bit in meeting some of the problems that we face domestically. I don\u2019t think that uh \u2013 America can go on a big spending spree with a whole lot of new programs uh \u2013 that would add significantly to the federal budget. I believe that the American people, if given the leadership that I would expect to give, would be willing to give this thrust to preserve the peace and the necessary restraint at home to hold the lid on spending so that we could, I think, have a long overdue and totally justified tax decrease for the middle-income people. And then, with the economy that would be generated from a restraint on spending, and a tax uh reduction primarily for the middle-income people, then I think the American people would be willing to make those sacrifices for peace and prosperity in the next uh \u2013 four years."}

Doesn\u2019t your policy really imply that we\u2019re going to have a fairly high rate of unemployment over a fairly long time, that growth is gonna be fairly slow, and that we\u2019re not gonna be able to do much \u2013 very much in the next four or five years to meet the basic agenda of our national needs in the cities, in health, uh in transit and a whole lot of things like that."}

FORD","Text":"No, Mr. Kraft, we\u2019re spending very significant amounts of money now, some $200 billion a year, almost 50 percent of our total federal expenditure uh \u2013 by the federal government at the present time for human needs. Now we will probably need to increase that to same extent. But we don\u2019t have to have \u2013 growth in spending that will blow the lid off and add to the problems of inflation. I believe we can meet the problems within the cities of this country and still uh \u2013 give a tax reduction. I proposed, as you know, a reduction to increase the personal exemption from seven hundred and fifty to a thousand dollars. With the fiscal program that I have, and if you look at the projections, it shows that we will reduce unemployment, that we will continue to win the battle against inflation, and at the same time give the kind of quality of life that I believe is possible in America. Uh \u2013 a job, a home for all those that\u2019ll work and save for it, uh \u2013 safety in the streets, uh \u2013 health that is a \u2013 health care that is affordable. These things can be done if we have the right vision and the right restraint and the right leadership."}

{"Title":"October 22, 1976 Debate Transcript","Debate":"The Third Carter-Ford Presidential Debate","Date":"October 22, 1976","Participants":"Carter-Ford","Moderators":"MS. WALTERS","Speaker":"MR. CARTER","Text":"Well I might say first of all that I think in case of the Carter administration the sacrifices would be much less. Mr. Ford\u2019s own uh \u2013 environmental agency has projected a 10 percent unemployment rate by 1978 if he\u2019s uh \u2013 president. The American people are ready to make sacrifices if they are part of the process. If they know that they will be helping to make decisions and won\u2019t be excluded from being an involved party to the national purpose. The major effort we must put forward is to put our people back to work. And I think that this uh \u2013 is one example where uh \u2013 a lot of people have selfish, grasping ideas now. I remember 1973 in the depth of the uh \u2013 energy crisis when President Nixon called on the American people to make a sacrifice, to cut down on the waste of uh \u2013 gasoline, to cut down on the uh \u2013 speed of automobiles. It was a \u2013 a tremendous surge of patriotism, that \u201cI want to make a sacrifice for my country.\u201d I think we uh \u2013 could call together, with strong leadership in the White House, business, industry and labor, and say let\u2019s have voluntary price restraints. Let\u2019s lay down some guidelines so we don\u2019t have continuing inflation. We can also have a- an end to the extremes. We now have one extreme for instance, of some welfare recipients, who by taking advantage of the welfare laws, the housing laws, the uh \u2013 Medicaid uh \u2013 laws, and the uh \u2013 food stamp laws, make over $10 thousand a year and uh \u2013 they don\u2019t have to pay any taxes on it. At the other extreme, uh \u2013 just 1 percent of the richest people in our country derive 25 percent of all the tax benefits. So both those extremes grasp for advantage and the person who has to pay that expense is the middle-income family who\u2019s still working for a living and they have to pay for the rich who have privilege, and for the poor who are not working. But I think uh \u2013 uh \u2013 a balanced approach, with everybody being part of it and a striving for unselfishness, could help as it did in 1973 to let people sacrifice for their own country. I know I\u2019m ready for it. I think the American people are too."}

MAYNARD","Text":"Governor, by all indications, the voters are so turned off by this election campaign so far that only half intend to vote. One major reason for this apathetic electorate appears to be the low level at which this campaign has been conducted. It has digressed frequently from important issues into allegations of blunder and brainwashing and fixations on lust and Playboy. What responsibility do you accept for the low level of this campaign for the nation\u2019s highest office?"}
{"Title":"October 22, 1976 Debate Transcript","Debate":"The Third Carter-Ford Presidential Debate","Date":"October 22, 1976","Participants":"Carter-Ford","Moderators":"MS. WALTERS","Speaker":"MR. CARTER","Text":"I think the major reason for a decrease in participation that we have experienced ever since 1960 has been the deep discouragement of the American people about the performance of public officials. When you\u2019ve got seven and a half, eight million people out of work, and you\u2019ve got three times as much inflation as you had during the last eight-year Democratic administration, when you have the highest deficits in history; when you have it uh \u2013 becoming increasingly difficult far a family to put a child through college or to own a home, there\u2019s a natural inclination to be turned off. Also, in the aftermath of Vietnam and Cambodia and uh \u2013 Watergate and uh \u2013 the CIA revelations, people have feel \u2013 have felt that they\u2019ve uh been betrayed by public officials, I have to admit that in the uh \u2013 heat of the campaign \u2013 I\u2019ve been in thirty primaries during the springtime, I\u2019ve been campaigning for twenty-two months \u2013 I\u2019ve made some mistakes. And I think this is uh \u2013 uh \u2013 part of uh \u2013 of just being a human being. I \u2013 I have to say that my campaign has been an open one. And uh \u2013 the Playboy thing has been of great \u2013 very great concern to me. I don\u2019t know how to deal with it exactly. Uh \u2013 I uh \u2013 agreed to give the interview uh \u2013 to Playboy Other people have done it who are notable \u2013 uh \u2013 Governor Jerry Brown, uh \u2013 Walter Cronkite, uh \u2013 Albert Schweitzer, Mr. Ford\u2019s own secretary of the treasury, Mr. Simon, uh \u2013 William Buckley \u2013 many other people. But they weren\u2019t running for president, and in retrospect, from hindsight, I would not have given that uh \u2013 interview had I do it \u2013 had it \u2013 I to do it over again. If I should ever decide in the future to discuss my \u2013 my deep Christian beliefs and uh \u2013 condemnation and sinfulness, I\u2019ll use another forum besides Playboy. But I can say this, uh \u2013 I\u2019m doing the best I can to get away from that, and during the next ten days, the American people will not see the Carter campaign running uh \u2013 television advertisements and newspaper advertisements based on a personal attack on President Ford\u2019s character. I believe that the opposite is true with President Ford\u2019s campaign, and uh \u2013 I hope that we can leave those issues in this next ten days about personalities and mistakes of the past \u2013 we\u2019ve both made some mistakes \u2013 and talk about unemployment, inflation, housing, education, taxation, government organization, stripping away of secrecy, and the things that are crucial to the American people. I regret the things in my own long campaign that have been mistaken, but I\u2019m trying to do away with those the last ten days."}

{"Title":"October 22, 1976 Debate Transcript","Debate":"The Third Carter-Ford Presidential Debate","Date":"October 22, 1976","Participants":"Carter-Ford","Moderators":"MS. WALTERS","Speaker":"MR. FORD","Text":"I believe that the uh \u2013 American people have been turned off in this election, uh \u2013 Mr. Maynard, for a variety of reasons. We have seen on Capitol Hill, in the Congress, uh \u2013 a great many uh \u2013 allegations of wrong-doing, of uh \u2013 alleged immorality, uh \u2013 those are very disturbing to the American people. They wonder how an elected representative uh \u2013 can serve them and participate in such activities uh \u2013 serving in the Congress of the United States. Yes, and I\u2019m certain many, many Americans were turned off by the revelations of Watergate, a very, very uh \u2013 bad period of time in American political history. Yes, and thousands, maybe millions of Americans were turned off because of the uh \u2013 problems that came out of our involvement in Vietnam. But on the other hand, I found on July fourth of this year, a new spirit born in America. We were celebrating our Bicentennial; and I find that uh \u2013 there is a \u2013 a movement as I travel around the country of greater interest in this campaign. Now, like uh \u2013 any hardworking uh \u2013 person seeking public office uh \u2013 in the campaign, inevitably sometimes you will use uh \u2013 rather graphic language and I\u2019m guilty of that just like I think most others in the political arena. But I do make a pledge that in the next ten days when we\u2019re asking the American people to make one of the most important decisions in their lifetime, because I think this election is one of the mast vital in the history of America, that uh \u2013 we do together what we can to stimulate voter participation."}

And, I know you\u2019ve answered questions on this before, but there are questions that still remain and I think people want to know what your role was. Will you name the persons you talked to in connection with that investigation, and since you say you have no recollection of talking to anyone from the White House, would you be willing to open for examination the White House tapes of conversations uh \u2013 during that period?"}
{"Title":"October 22, 1976 Debate Transcript","Debate":"The Third Carter-Ford Presidential Debate","Date":"October 22, 1976","Participants":"Carter-Ford","Moderators":"MS. WALTERS","Speaker":"MR. FORD","Text":"Well, Mr. uh \u2013 Nelson, uh \u2013 I testified before two committees, House and Senate, on precisely the questions that you have asked. And the testimony under oath was to the effect that I did not talk to Mr. Nixon, to Mr. Haldeman, to Mr. Ehrlichman, or to any of the people at the White House. I said I had no recollection whatsoever of talking with any of the White House legislative liaison people. I indicated under oath that the initiative that I took was at the request of the ranking members of the House Banking and Currency Committee on the Republican side, which was a legitimate request and a proper response by me. Now that was gone into by two congressional committees, and following that investigation, both committees overwhelmingly approved me, and the House and the Senate did likewise. Now, in the meantime, the special prosecutor, within the last few days, after an investigation himself, said there was no reason for him to get involved because he found nothing that would justify it. And then just a day or two ago, the attorney general of the United States made a further investigation and came to precisely the same conclusion. Now, after all of those investigations by objective, responsible people, I think the matter is closed once and for all. But to add one other feature, I don\u2019t control any of the tapes. Those tapes are in the jurisdiction of the courts and I have no right to say \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno.\u201d But all the committees, the attorney general, the special prosecutor, all of them have given me a clean bill of health. I think the matter is settled once and for all."}

And I don\u2019t think there is any question about whether or not uh \u2013 there was criminal prosecution, but whether \u2013 whether you have told the American people your entire involvement in it. And whether you would be willing, even if you don\u2019t control the tapes, whether you would be willing to ask that the tapes be released for examination."}

I have given every bit of evidence, answered every question that\u2019s as- been asked me by any senator or any member of the House. Plus the fact, that the special prosecutor, on his own initiation, and the attorney general on his initiation, the highest law enforcement official in this country, all of them have given me a clean bill of health.

Uh \u2013 it\u2019s pretty certain that the Russians are gonna do everything they possibly can after Tito dies to force Yugoslavia back into the Soviet camp. But last Saturday you said, and this is a quote, \u201cI would not go to war in Yugoslavia, even if the Soviet Union sent in troops.\u201d Doesn\u2019t that statement practically invite the Russians to intervene in Yugoslavia? Ah \u2013 doesn\u2019t it discourage Yugoslavs who might be tempted to resist? And wouldn\u2019t it have been wiser on your part uh \u2013 to say nothing and to keep the Russians in the dark as President Ford did, and as I think every president has done since \u2013 since President Truman?"}
{"Title":"October 22, 1976 Debate Transcript","Debate":"The Third Carter-Ford Presidential Debate","Date":"October 22, 1976","Participants":"Carter-Ford","Moderators":"MS. WALTERS","Speaker":"MR. CARTER","Text":"In the last uh \u2013 two weeks, I\u2019ve had a chance to talk to uh \u2013 two men who have visited uh \u2013 the Soviet Union, Yugoslavia and China. One is Governor Avell- Averell Harriman, who visited the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia, and the other is James Schlesinger, whom I think you accompanied to uh \u2013 China. I got a- a complete report back from those countries from these two distinguished \u2013 uh \u2013 gentlemen. Mr. Harriman talked to the leaders in Yugoslavia, and I think it\u2019s accurate to say that there is no uh \u2013 prospect in their opinion, of the Soviet Union invading uh \u2013 Yugoslavia should uh \u2013 Mr. Tito pass away. The present leadership uh \u2013 there is uh \u2013 is fairly uniform in \u2013 in their purpose, and I think it\u2019s a close-knit group, uh \u2013 and uh \u2013 I think it would be unwise for us to say that we will go to war uh \u2013 in Yugoslavia uh \u2013 if the Soviets should invade, which I think would be an extremely unlikely thing. I have maintained from the very beginning of my campaign, and this was a standard answer that I made in response to the Yugoslavian question, that I would never uh \u2013 go to war or become militarily involved, in the internal affairs of another country unless our own security was direc- rectly threatened. And uh \u2013 I don\u2019t believe that our security would be directly threatened if the Soviet Union went uh \u2013 into Yugoslavia. I don\u2019t believe it will happen. I certainly hope it won\u2019t. I would take eh \u2013 the strongest possible measures short of uh \u2013 actual military uh \u2013 action there by our own troops, but I doubt that that would be an eventuality."}

I think we all recall with some sadness that at uh \u2013 the period of the nin- late nineteen forties, early nineteen fifties, there were some indications that the United States would not include uh \u2013 South Korea in an area of defense. There are some who allege, I can\u2019t prove it true or untrue, that uh \u2013 such a statement uh \u2013 in effect invited the North Koreans to invade South Korea. It\u2019s a fact they did. But no president of the United States, in my opinion, should signal in advance to a prospective enemy, what his uhh \u2013 decision might be or what option he might exercise. It\u2019s far better for a person sitting in the White House uh \u2013 who has a number of options to make certain that the uh \u2013 other side, so to speak, doesn\u2019t know precisely what you\u2019re going to do.

And General Brown has indicated uh \u2013 his apology, his regrets, and I think that will, uh \u2013 in this situation, settle the matter. It is tragic that uh \u2013 the full transcript of that interview was not released and that there were excerpts, some of the excerpts, taken out of context. Not this one, however, that you bring up. General Brown has an exemply [sic] record of military performance. He served this nation with great, great skill and courage and bravery for thirty-five years. And I think it\u2019s the consensus of the people who are knowledgeable in the military field, that he is probably the outstanding military leader and strategist that we have in America today. Now he did use uh \u2013 ill-advised words, but I think in the fact that he apologized, that he was reprimanded, uh \u2013 does permit him to stay on and continue that kind of leadership that\u2019s we so badly need as we enter into uh \u2013 negotiations uh \u2013 under the SALT II agreement, or if we have operations that might be developing uh in the Middle East or southern Africa, in the Pacific, uh \u2013 we need a man with that experience, that knowledge, that know-how, and I think, in light of the fact that he has uh \u2013 apologized, uh \u2013 would not have justified my asking for his resignation."}

This one concerned uh \u2013 Great Britain. I think he said that Israel was a \u2013 a military burden on us and that Iran hoped to reestablish the Persian Empire. Ah \u2013 I\u2019m not uh \u2013 sure that I remembered earlier that President Ford had \u2013 had expressed uh \u2013 his concern about the statement or apologized for it. This is uh \u2013 something, though, that I think uh \u2013 is indicative of the need among the American people to know how its commander-in-chief, the president, feels and \u2013 and \u2013 and I think the only criticism that I would have uh \u2013 on \u2013 of Mr. Ford is that uh \u2013 immediately when the statement was re \u2013 re \u2013 revealed, uh \u2013 perhaps a \u2013 a statement from the president would have been a clarifying and a very beneficial thing."}

CARTER","Text":"I don\u2019t believe it does. Uh \u2013 I began campaigning uh \u2013 twenty-two months ago. At that time, nobody thought I had a chance to win. Uh \u2013 very few people knew who I was. I came from a tiny town, as you know, Plains, and didn\u2019t hold public office, didn\u2019t have very much money. And my first organization was just four or five people plus my wife and my children, my three sons and their wives. And we won the nomination by going out into the streets \u2013 barbershops, beauty parlors, restaurants, stores, in factory shift lines also in farmers\u2019 markets and livestock sale barns \u2013 and we talked a lot and we listened a lot and we learned from the American people. And we built up uh \u2013 an awareness among the uh \u2013 voters of this country, particularly those in whose primaries I entered \u2013 thirty of them, nobody\u2019s ever done that before \u2013 about who I was and what I stood for. Now we have a very, very wide-ranging group of advisers who help me prepare for these debates and who teach me about international economics, and foreign affairs, defense matters, health, education, welfare, government reorganization. I\u2019d say, several hundred of them. And they\u2019re very fine and very highly qualified. The one major decision that I have made since acquiring the nomination, and I share this with President Ford, is the choice of a vice president. I think this should be indicative of the kind of leaders I would choose to help me if I am elected. I chose Senator Walter Mondale. And the only criterion I ever put forward in my own mind was who among the several million people in this country would be the best person qualified to be president, if something should happen to me and to join me in being vice president if I should serve out my term. And I\u2019m convinced now, more than I was when I got the nomination, that Walter Mondale was the right choice, And I believe this is a good indication of the kind of people I would choose in the future. Mr. Ford has had that same choice to make. I don\u2019t want to say anything critical of Senator Dole, but I\u2019ve never heard Mr. Ford say that that was his prim- primary consideration \u2013 Who is the best person I could choose in this country to be president of the United States? I feel completely at ease knowing that someday Senator Mondale might very well be president. In the last five pres- vice presidential uh \u2013 nominees, uh \u2013 incumbents, three of them have become president. But I think this is indicative of what I would do."}

And Senator Bob Dole is so qualified: sixteen years in the House of Representatives and in the Senate, uhh \u2013 very high responsibilities on important committees. I don\u2019t mean to be critical of uh \u2013 Senator Mondale, but uh \u2013 I was uh \u2013 very, very surprised when I read that uh \u2013 Senator Mondale made a very derogatory, very personal comment about General Brown uh \u2013 after the news story that uh \u2013 broke about General Brown. If my recollection is correct he indicated that uh \u2013 General Brown was not qualified to be a sewer commissioner. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a proper way to describe aayuh- chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff who has fought for his country for thirty-five years, and I\u2019m sure the governor would agree with me on that. Uh \u2013 I think Senator Dole would show more good judgment and discretion than to so describe uh \u2013 a heroic and brave and very outstanding leader of the military. So I think our selection uh \u2013 of Bob Dole as vice president uh \u2013 is based on merit. And if he should ever become uh \u2013 the president of the United States, with his vast experience as member the House and a member of the Senate, as well as a vice president, I think he would do an outstanding job as president of the United States."}

{"Title":"October 22, 1976 Debate Transcript","Debate":"The Third Carter-Ford Presidential Debate","Date":"October 22, 1976","Participants":"Carter-Ford","Moderators":"MS. WALTERS","Speaker":"MR. FORD","Text":"Well, first, uh \u2013 let me set the record straight. I vetoed the strip-mining bill, Mr. Kraft, because it was the overwhelming consensus of knowledgeable people that that strip-mining bill would have meant the loss of literally uh \u2013 thousands of jobs, something around a hundred and forty thousand jabs. Number two, that strip-mining bill would\u2019ve severely set back our need for more coal, and Governor Carter has said repeatedly that coal is the resource that we need to use more in the effort to become independent of the uh \u2013 Arab oil supply. So, I vetoed it because of a loss of jobs and because it would\u2019ve interfered with our energy independence program. The auto emissions \u2013 uh \u2013 it was agreed by Leonard Woodcock, the head of the UAW, and by the uh \u2013 heads of all of the automobile industry, we had labor and management together saying that those auto emission standards had to be modified. But let\u2019s talk about what the Ford administration has done in the field of environment. I have increased, as president, by over 60 percent the funding for water treatment plants in the United States, the federal contribution. I have fully funded the land and water conservation program; in fact, have recommended and the Congress approved a substantially increased land and water conservation program. Uh \u2013 I have uh \u2013 added in the current year budget the funds for the National Park Service. For example, we uh \u2013 proposed about $12 million to add between four and five hundred more employees for the National Park Service. And a month or so ago I did uh \u2013 likewise say over the next ten years we should expand \u2013 double \u2013 this national parks, the wild wilderness areas, the scenic river areas. And then, of course, the \u2013 the final thing is that I have signed and approved of more scenic rivers, more wilderness areas, since I\u2019ve been president than any other president in the history of the United States."}

CARTER","Text":"Well, I might say that I think the League of Conservation Voters is absolutely right. This uh \u2013 administration\u2019s record on environment is very bad. Uh \u2013 I think it\u2019s accurate to say that the uh \u2013 strip-mining law which was passed twice by the Congress \u2013 uh \u2013 and was only like two votes I believe of being overridden \u2013 would have been good for the country. The claim that it would have put hundred and forty thousand miners out of work is uh \u2013 hard to believe, when at the time Mr. Ford vetoed it, the United Mine Workers was uh \u2013 supporting the bill. And I don\u2019t think they would have supported the uh \u2013 bill had they known that they would lose a hundred and forty thousand jobs. There\u2019s been a consistent policy on the part of this administration to lower or delay enforcement of air pollution standards and water pollution standards. And under both President Nixon and Ford, monies have been impounded that would\u2019ve gone to uh \u2013 cities and others to control uh \u2013 water pollution. We have no energy policy. We, I think, are the only developed nation in the world that has no comprehensive energy policy, to permit us to plan in an orderly way how to shift from increasing the scarce uh \u2013 energy uh \u2013 forms: oil, and have research and development concentrated on the increased use of coal, which I strongly favor. The research and development to be used primary to make the coal burning uh \u2013 be clean. We need a heritage trust program, similar to the one we had in Georgia, to set aside additional lands that have uh \u2013 geological and archeological importance, uh natural areas for enjoyment. Uh \u2013 the lands that Mr. Ford uh \u2013 brags about having approved are in Alaska and they are enormous in uh \u2013 in size. But as far as the accessibility of them by the American people, it\u2019s very uh \u2013 far in the future. We\u2019ve taken no strong position in the uh \u2013 control of pollution of our oceans, and I would say the worst uh \u2013 threat to the environment of all is nuclear proliferation. And this administration, having been in office now for two years or more, has still not taken strong and bold action to stop the proliferation of nuclear waste around the world, particularly plutonium. Those are some brief remarks about the failures of this administration. I would do the opposite in every respect."}

{"Title":"October 22, 1976 Debate Transcript","Debate":"The Third Carter-Ford Presidential Debate","Date":"October 22, 1976","Participants":"Carter-Ford","Moderators":"MS. WALTERS","Speaker":"MR. CARTER","Text":"Yes, I\u2019d be glad to. In the first place, uh \u2013 as is the case with the environmental policy and the energy policy that I just described, and the policy for nonproliferation of uh \u2013 of nuclear waste, this administration has no urban policy. It\u2019s impossible for mayors or governors to cooperate with the resident, because they can\u2019t anticipate what\u2019s gonna happen next. A mayor of a city like New York, for instance, needs to know uh \u2013 eighteen months or two years ahead of time what responsibility the city will have in administration and in financing \u2013 in things like housing, uh \u2013 pollution control, uh \u2013 crime control, education, welfare and health. This has not been done, unfortunately. I remember the headline in the Daily News that said, \u201cFord to New York: Drop Dead.\u201d I think it\u2019s very important that our cities know that they have a partner in the federal government. Quite often Congress has passed laws in the past designed to help people with uh \u2013 the ownership of homes and with the control of crime and with adequate health care and education programs and so forth. Uh \u2013 those uh programs were designed to help those who need it most. And quite often this has been in the very poor people and neighborhoods in the downtown urban centers. Because of the uh \u2013 great -ly- greatly uh \u2013 advantaged uh \u2013 tho- per \u2013 persons who live in the suburbs, better education, better organization, more articulate, more aware of what the laws are, quite often this money has been channeled out of the downtown centers where it\u2019s needed. Also I favor all revenue sharing money being used for local governments, and also to remove prohibitions in the use of revenue sharing money so that it can be used to improve education, and health care. We have now uh \u2013 for instance only 7 percent of the total education cost being financed by the federal government. When uh \u2013 the Nixon-Ford Administration started, this was 10 percent. That\u2019s a 30 percent reduction in the portion that the federal government contributes to education in just eight years. And as you know, the education cost has gone up uh \u2013 tremendously. The last point is that the major \u2013 uh thrust has gotta be to put people back to work. We\u2019ve got an extraordinarily high unemployment rate among downtown urban ghetto areas, uh \u2013 particularly among the very poor and particularly among minority groups, sometimes 50 or 60 percent. And the concentration of employment opportunities in those areas would help greatly not only to reestablish the tax base, but also to help reduce the extraordinary welfare cost. One of the major responsibilities on the shoulders of uh \u2013 New York City is to \u2013 is to finance welfare. And I favor a shifting of the welfare cost away from the local governments altogether. And over a longer period of time, let the federal government begin to absorb part of it that\u2019s now paid by the state governments. Those things would help a great deal with the cities, but we still have a \u2013 a very serious problem there."}

I fought for, and the Congress finally went along with a general revenue sharing program, whereby cities and uh \u2013 states, uh \u2013 the cities two-thirds and the states one-third, get over six billion dollars a year in cash through which they can uh \u2013 provide many, many services, whatever they really want. In addition we uh \u2013 in the federal government make available to uh \u2013 cities about uh \u2013 three billion three hundred million dollars in what we call community development. In adesh- in addition, uh \u2013 uh \u2013 as a result of my pressure an the Congress, we got a major mass transit program uh \u2013 over a four-year period, eleven billion eight-hundred million dollars. We have a good housing program, uh \u2013 that uh \u2013 will result in cutting uh \u2013 the down payments by 50 percent and uh \u2013 having mortgage payments uh lower at the beginning of any mortgage period.

As a matter of fact, that committee under Secretary Hills released about a seventy-five-page report with specific recommendations so we can do a better job uh \u2013 the weeks ahead.

In the cabinet I have one of the outstanding, I think, administrators as the secretary of transportation, Bill Coleman. You\u2019re familiar, I\u2019m sure, with the recognition given in the Air Force to uh \u2013 General James, and there was just uh \u2013 approved a three-star admiral, the first in the history of the United States Navy, so uh \u2013 we are giving full recognition to individuals of quality in the Ford administration in positions of great responsibility. In addition, uh \u2013 the Department of Justice is fully enforcing, and enforcing effectively, the Voting Rights Act, the legislation that involves jobs, housing for minorities, not only blacks but all others. Uh \u2013 the Department of uh \u2013 uh \u2013 HUD is enforcing the new legislation that uhh \u2013 outlaws, that takes care of redlining. Uh \u2013 what we\u2019re doing is saying that there are opportunities, business opportunities, educational opportunities, responsibilities uh \u2013 where people with talent, black or any other minority, can fully qualify. The Office of Minority Business in the Department of Commerce has made available more money in trying to help uh \u2013 black businessmen or other minority businessmen than any other administration since the office was established. The Office of Small Business, under Mr. Kobelinski, has a very massive program trying to help the black community. The individual who wants to start a business or expand his business as a black businessman is able to borrow, either directly or with guaranteed loans. I believe on the record that this administration has been more responsive and we have carried out the law to the letter, and I\u2019m proud of the record."}

CARTER","Text":"The uh \u2013 description just made of this administration\u2019s record is hard to uh \u2013 recognize. I think it\u2019s accurate to say that Mr. Ford voted against the uh \u2013 Voting Rights Acts and the uh \u2013 Civil Rights Acts in their uh \u2013 debative stage I think once it was assured they were going to pass he finally voted for it. This country uh \u2013 changed drastically in 1969 when the uh \u2013 terms of John Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson were over and Richard Nixon and \u2013 and Gerald Ford became the presidents. There was a time when there was hope for those who uh \u2013 were poor and downtrodden and who were \u2013 uh elderly or who were \u2013 uh ill or who were in minority groups, but that time has been gone. I think the greatest thing that ever happened to the South was the passage of the Civil Rights Act and the opening up of opportunities \u2013 uh to black people \u2013 the chance to vote, to hold a job, to buy a house, to go to school, and to participate in public affairs. It not only liberated \u2013 uh black people but it also liberated the whites. We\u2019ve seen uh \u2013 in many instances in recent years a minority affairs uh \u2013 section of uh Small Loan Administration, uh \u2013 Small Business Administration lend uh \u2013 a black entrepreneur just enough money to get started, and then to go bankrupt. The bankruptcies have gone up \u2013 uh in an extraordinary degree. Uh \u2013 FHA, which used to be a very responsible agency, uh \u2013 that everyone looked to to help own a home, lost six million dollars last year. There\u2019ve been over thirteen hundred indictments in HUD, over eight hundred convictions relating just to home loans. And now the federal government has become the world\u2019s greatest slum landlord. We\u2019ve got a 30 percent or 40 percent unemployment rate among minority uh \u2013 young people. And there\u2019s been no concerted effort given to the needs of those who are both poor and black, or poor and who speak a foreign language. And that\u2019s where there\u2019s been a great uh generation of despair, and ill health, and the lack of education, lack of purposefulness, and the lack of hope for the future. But it doesn\u2019t take just a quiet uh \u2013 dormant uh minimum enforcement of the law. It requires an aggressive searching out and reaching out to help people who especially need it. And that\u2019s been lacking in the last eight years."}

Uh I call that the people amendment. I think if you really believe that the people of a state ought to make a decision on a matter of this kind that uh \u2013 we ought to have a federal constitutional amendment that would permit each one of the fifty states to make the choice.

The record just doesn\u2019t prove that such legislation or action by a local city council is effective. What we have to do, and this is the crux of the matter, is to make it very, very uh \u2013 difficult for a person who uses a gun in the commission of a crime to stay out of jail. If we make the use of a gun in the commission. of a crime a serious criminal offense, and that person is prosecuted, then, in my opinion, we are going after the person who uses the gun for the wrong reason. I don\u2019t believe in the registration of handguns or the registration of the handgun owner. That has not proven to be effective, and therefore, I think the better way is to go after the criminal, the individual who commits a crime in the possession of a gun and uses that gun for a part of his criminal activity. Those are the people who ought to be in jail. And the only way to do it is to pass strong legislation so that once apprehended, indicted, convicted, they\u2019ll be in jail and off the streets and not using guns in the commission of a crime."}

We uh \u2013 streamlined the structure of the court, put in administrative officers, put a unified court system in, required that all uh \u2013 severe sentences be reviewed far uniformity. And, in addition to that put forward a proposal that was adopted and used throughout my own term of office of selection of \u2013 for all judges and district attorneys or prosecuting attorneys, on the basis of merit. Every time I had a vacancy on the Georgia Supreme Court \u2013 and I filled five of those vacancies out of seven total and about half the court of appeals judges, about 35 percent of the trial judges \u2013 I was given from an objective panel the five most highly qualified persons in Georgia. And from those five, I always chose the first one or second one. So merit selection of judges is the most important single criterion. And I would institute the same kind of procedure as president, not only in judicial appointments, but also in diplomatic appointments. Secondly, I think that the Burger Court has fairly well confirmed the major and \u2013 and most far-reaching and most controversial decisions of the Warren Court. Civil rights \u2013 uh has been confirmed by the Burger Court, hasn\u2019t been uh \u2013 reversed, and I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any inclination to reverse those basic decisions. The one-man, one-vote rule, which is a very important one that uh \u2013 s- struck down the unwarranted influence in the legislature of parsley \u2013 uh populated areas of \u2013 of the states. The uh \u2013 right of indigent or very poor accused persons to uh \u2013 legal counsel. Uh \u2013 I think the Burger Court has confirmed that basic and very controversial decision of the Warren Court. Also the \u2013 the protection of an arrested person against unwarranted persecution in trying to get a false uh \u2013 confession. But now I think there have been a couple of instances where the Burger Court has made technical rulings where an obviously guilty person was later found to be guilty. And I think that in that case uh \u2013 some of the more liberal uh \u2013 members of the uh \u2013 so-called Warren Court agreed with those decisions. But the only uh \u2013 thing I uh \u2013 have pointed out was, what I\u2019ve just said, and that there was a need to clarify the technicalities so that you couldn\u2019t be forced to release a person who was obviously guilty just because of a \u2013 of a small technicality in the law.

Yes, it was announced that the uh \u2013 GNP real growth in the third quarter was at 4 percent. But do you realize that over the last ten years that\u2019s a higher figure than the average growth during that ten-year period? Now it\u2019s lower than the nine-point-point-two percent growth in the first quarter, and it\u2019s lower than the uh 5 percent growth in the second quarter. But every economist \u2013 liberal, conservative that I\u2019m familiar with \u2013 recognizes that in the fourth quarter of this year and in the fifth quar- uh \u2013 the first quarter of next year that we\u2019ll have an increase in real GNP. But now let\u2019s talk about the pluses that came out this week. We had an 18 percent increase in housing starts. We had a substantial increase in new permits for housing. As a matter of fact, based on the announcement this week, there will be at an annual rate of a million, eight hundred and some thousand new houses built, which is a tremendous increase over last year and a substantial increase over the earlier part of this year. Now in addition, we had a very \u2013 some very good news in the reduction in the rate of inflation. And inflation hits everybody: those who are working and those who are on welfare. The rate of inflation, as announced just the other day, is under 5 percent; and the uh \u2013 4.4 percent that was indicated at the time of the 4 percent GNP was less than the 5.4 percent. It means that the American buyer is getting a better bargain today because inflation is less."}

Since the depths of the recession, we have added four million jobs. Im- most importantly, consumer confidence as surveyed by the reputable organization at the University of Michigan is at the highest since 1972. In other words, there is a growing public confidence in the strength of this economy. And that means that there will be more industrial activity.

Now we\u2019ve had this pause, but most economists, regardless of their political philosophy, uh \u2013 indicate that this pause for a month or two was healthy, because we could not have honestly sustained a 9.2 percent rate of growth which we had in the first quarter of this year.

We\u2019ve got seven and a half million people out of jobs. Since he\u2019s been in office, two and a half million more American people have lost their jobs. In the last four months alone, five hundred thousand Americans have gone on the unemployment roll. In the last month, we\u2019ve had a net loss of one hundred and sixty-three thousand jobs. Anybody who says that the inflation rate is in good shape now ought to talk to the housewives. One of the overwhelming results that I\u2019ve seen in the polls is that people feel that you can\u2019t plan anymore. There\u2019s no way to make a prediction that my family might be able to own a home or to put my kid through college. Savings accounts are losing money instead of gaining money. Inflation is robbing us. Under the present administration \u2013 Nixon\u2019s and Ford\u2019s \u2013 we\u2019ve had three times the inflation rate that we experienced under President Johnson and President Kennedy. The economic growth is less than half today what it was at the beginning of this year. And housing starts \u2013 he compares the housing starts with last year. I don\u2019t blame him, because in 1975 we had fewer housing starts in this country, fewer homes built, than any year since 1940. That\u2019s thirty-five years. And we\u2019ve got a 35 percent unemployment rate in many areas of this country among construction workers. And Mr. Ford hasn\u2019t done anything about it. And I think this shows a callous indifference to the families that have suffered so much. He has vetoed bills passed by Congress within the congressional budget guidelines job opportunities for two million Americans. We\u2019ll never have a balanced budget, we\u2019ll never meet the needs of our people, we\u2019ll never control the inflationary spiral, as long as we have seven and a half or eight million people out of work, who are looking for jobs. And we\u2019ve probably got two and a half more million people who are not looking for jobs any more, because they\u2019ve given up hope. That is a very serious indictment of this administration.

When I was that far ahead, it was immediately following the Democratic Convention, and before the Republican Convention. At that time, uh \u2013 25 or 30 percent of the Reagan supporters said that they would not support President Ford. But as occurred at the end of the con- Democratic Convention, the Republican Party unified itself. And I think immediately following the Republican Convention, there was about a ten-point spread. I believe that to be accurate, I had 49 percent; President Ford, 39 percent. Uh \u2013 the polls uh \u2013 are good indications of fluctuations, but they vary widely one from another. And the only poll I\u2019ve ever followed is the one that uh \u2013 you know, is taken on election day. I was in uh \u2013 thirty primaries in the spring, and uh \u2013 at first it was obvious that I didn\u2019t have any standing in the poll. As a matter of fact, I think when Gallup ran their first poll in December of 1975 they didn\u2019t put my name on the list. They had thirty-five people on the list. My name wasn\u2019t even there. And at the beginning of the year I had about 2 percent. So the polls to me are interesting, but they don\u2019t determine, you know, my hopes or \u2013 or my despair. I campaign among people. I\u2019ve never depended on powerful political figures to put me in office. I have a direct relationship with hundreds of people around \u2013 hundreds of thousands around the country who actively campaign for me. In Georgia alone, for instance, I got 84 percent of the vote, and I think there were fourteen people uh \u2013 in addition to myself on the ballot, and Governor Wallace had been very strong in Georgia. That\u2019s an overwhelming support from my own people who know me best. And today, we have about five hundred Georgians at their own expense \u2013 just working people who believe in me \u2013 spread around the country uh \u2013 involved in the political campaign. So, the polls are interesting, but uh \u2013 I don\u2019t know how to explain the fluctuation. I think a lot of it uh \u2013 depends on current events \u2013 uh \u2013 sometimes foreign affairs, sometimes domestic affairs. But I think our hold uh \u2013 of support among those who uh \u2013 are crucial to the election has been fairly steady. And my success in the primary season was, I think, notable for a newcomer, from someone who\u2019s from outside Washington, who \u2013 who never has been a part of the Washington establishment. And I think that we\u2019ll have good results uh \u2013 on November the second for myself and I hope for the country."}

{"Title":"October 22, 1976 Debate Transcript","Debate":"The Third Carter-Ford Presidential Debate","Date":"October 22, 1976","Participants":"Carter-Ford","Moderators":"MS. WALTERS","Speaker":"MR. FORD","Text":"I think uh \u2013 the uh \u2013 increase and the uh \u2013 prospects as far as I\u2019m concerned and the I \u2013 less favorable prospects for Governor Carter, reflect that Governor Carter uh \u2013 is inconsistent in many of the positions that he takes. He tends to distort on a number of occasions. Uh \u2013 just a moment ago, for example, uh \u2013 he uh \u2013 was indicating that uh \u2013 uh \u2013 in the 1950s, for example, uh \u2013 unemployment was very low. He fails to point out that uh \u2013 in the 1950s we were engaged in the war in Vietnam. We \u2013 I mean in Korea \u2013 we had uh \u2013 three million five hundred thousand young men uh \u2013 in the Army, Navy, Air Force and Marines. That\u2019s not the way to end unemployment or to reduce unemployment. At the present time we\u2019re at peace. We have reduced the number of people in the Army, Navy, Air Force and Marines from three million, one hundred \u2013 three million, five hundred thousand to two mil- lion one hundred thousand. We are not at war. We have reduced the military manpower by a million four hundred thousand. If we had that many more people in the Army, the Navy, the Air Force, and Marines, our unemployment figure would be considerably less. But this administration doesn\u2019t believe the way to reduce unemployment is to go to war, or to increase the number of people in the military. So you cannot compare unemployment, as you sought to, uh \u2013 with the present time with the 1950s, because the then administration had people in the military \u2013 they were at war, they were fighting overseas, and this administration has reduced the size of the military by a million four hundred thousand. They\u2019re in the civilian labor market and they\u2019re not fighting anywhere around the world today."}

{"Title":"October 22, 1976 Debate Transcript","Debate":"The Third Carter-Ford Presidential Debate","Date":"October 22, 1976","Participants":"Carter-Ford","Moderators":"MS. WALTERS","Speaker":"MR. FORD","Text":"For twenty-five years I served in the Congress under five presidents. I saw them work, I saw them make very hard decisions. I didn\u2019t always agree with their decisions, whether they were Democratic or Republican presidents. For the last two years, I\u2019ve been the president, and I have found from experience that it\u2019s much more difficult to make those decisions than it is to second-guess them. I became president at the time that the United States was in a very troubled time. We had inflation of over 12 percent, we were on the brink of the worst recession in the last forty years, we were still deeply involved in the problems of Vietnam. The American people had lost faith and trust and confidence in the presidency itself. That uh \u2013 situation called for me to first put the United States on a steady course and to keep our keel well balanced, because we had to face the difficult problems that had all of a sudden hit America. I think most people know that I did not seek the presidency. But I am asking for your help and assistance to be president for the next four years. During this campaign we\u2019ve seen a lot of television shows, a lot of bumper stickers, and a great many uh \u2013 slogans of one kind or another. But those are not the things that count. What counts is, that the United States celebrated its 200th birthday on July fourth. As a result of that wonderful experience all over the United States, there is a new spirit in America. The American people are healed, are working together. The American people are moving again, and moving in the right direction. We have cut inflation by better than half. We have came out of the recession and we\u2019re well on the road to real prosperity in this country again. There has been a restoration of faith and confidence and trust in the presidency because I\u2019ve been open, candid and forthright. I have never promised more than I could produce and I have produced everything that I promised. We are at peace. Not a single young American is fighting or dying on any foreign soil tonight. We have peace with freedom. I\u2019ve been proud to be president of the United States during these very troubled times. I love America just as all of you love America. It would be the highest honor for me to have your support on November second and for you to say, \u201cJerry Ford, you\u2019ve done a good job, keep on doing it.\u201d Thank you, and good night."}

{"Title":"October 22, 1976 Debate Transcript","Debate":"The Third Carter-Ford Presidential Debate","Date":"October 22, 1976","Participants":"Carter-Ford","Moderators":"MS. WALTERS","Speaker":"MR. CARTER","Text":"Thank you Barbara (barely audible). The major purpose of an election for president is to choose a leader. Someone who can analyze the depths of feeling in our country to set a standard for our people to follow, to inspire our people to reach for greatness, to correct our defects, to answer difficult questions, to bind ourselves together in a spirit of unity. I don\u2019t believe the present administration has done that. We have been discouraged and we\u2019ve been alienated. Sometimes we\u2019ve been embarrassed and sometimes we\u2019ve been ashamed. Our people are out of work, and there\u2019s a sense of withdrawal. But our country is innately very strong. Mr. Ford is a good and decent man, but he\u2019s in \u2013 been in office now more than eight hundred days approaching almost as long as John Kennedy was in office. I\u2019d like to ask the American people what, what\u2019s been accomplished. A lot remains to be done. My own background is different from his. I was a school board member, and a library board member. I served an a hospital authority. And I was in the state senate and I was governor and I\u2019m an engineer, a Naval officer, a farmer, a businessman. And I believe we require someone who can work harmoniously with the Congress, who can work closely with the people of this country, and who can bring a new image and a new spirit to Washington. Our tax structure is a disgrace, it needs to be reformed. I was Governor of Georgia for four years. We never increased sales taxes or income tax or property tax. As a matter of fact, the year before I went out of office we gave a $50 million refund to the property taxpayers of Georgia. We spend six hundred dollars per person in this country \u2013 every man, woman and child \u2013 for health care. We still rank fifteenth among all the nations of the world in infant mortality. And our cancer rate is uh \u2013 higher than any country in the world. We don\u2019t have good health care. We could have it. Employment ought to be restored to our people. We\u2019ve become almost a welfare state. We spend now 700 percent more on unemployment compensation than we did eight years ago when the Republicans took over the White House. Our people wanna go back to work. Our education system can be improved. Secrecy ought to be stripped away from government and a maximum of personal privacy ought to be maintained. Our housing programs have uh \u2013 gone bad. It used to be that the average \u2013 uh family could own a house. But now less than a third of our people can afford to buy their own homes. The budget was more grossly out of balance last year than ever before in the history of our country \u2013 $65 billion \u2013 primarily because our people are not at work. Inflation is robbing us, as we\u2019ve already discussed, and the government bureaucracy is uh \u2013 just a horrible mess. This doesn\u2019t have to be. Now I don\u2019t know all the answers. Nobody could. But I do know that if the president of the United States and the Congress of the United States and the people of the United States said, \u201cI believe our nation is greater than what we are now.\u201d I believe that if we are inspired, if we can achieve a degree of unity, if we can set our goals high enough and work toward recognized goals with industry and labor and agriculture along with government at all levels, then we can achieve great things. We might have to do it slowly. There are no magic answers to do it. But I believe together we can make great progress. We can correct our difficult mistakes and answer those very tough questions. I believe in the greatness of our country, and I believe the American people are ready for a change in Washington. We\u2019ve been drifting too long. We\u2019ve been dormant too long. We\u2019ve been discouraged too long. And we have not set an example for our own people. But I believe that we can now establish in the White House a good relationship with Congress, a good relationship with our people, set very high goals for our country. And with inspiration and hard work we can achieve great things. And let the world know \u2013 that\u2019s very important. But more importantly, let the people in our own country realize that we still live in the greatest nation on earth. Thank you very much."}

WALTERS","Text":"Thank you, Governor Carter, and thank you, President Ford. I also would like to thank the audience and my three colleagues \u2013 Mr. Kraft, Mr. Maynard and Mr. Nelson \u2013 who have been our questioners. This debate has, of course, been seen by millions of Americans and, in addition, tonight is being broadcast to one hundred and thirteen nations throughout the world. This concludes the 1976 presidential debates, a truly remarkable exercise in democracy, for this is the first time in sixteen years that the presidential candidates have debated. It is the first time ever that an incumbent president has debated his challenger. And the debate included the first between the two vice presidential candidates. President Ford and Governor Carter, we not only want to thank you, but we commend you for agreeing to come together to discuss the issues before the American people. And our special thanks to the League of Women Voters for making these events possible. In sponsoring these events, the League of Women Voters Education Fund has tried to provide you with the information that you will need to choose wisely. The election is now only eleven days off. The candidates have participated in presenting their views in three ninety-minute debates, and now it\u2019s up to the voters, now it is up to you, to participate. The League urges all registered voters to vote on November second for the candidate of your choice. And now, from Phi Beta Kappa Memorial Hall an the campus of the College of William and Mary, this is Barbara Walters wishing you all a good evening."}
