What troubles me more is how this administration has handled all of these issues. Look at what they\u2019re doing through Obamacare with respect to assaulting the religious liberties of this country. They\u2019re infringing upon our first freedom, the freedom of religion, by infringing on Catholic charities, Catholic churches, Catholic hospitals."}
