We\u2019re making history now and it\u2019s pretty exciting. An independent polling firm has selected an audience of 209 uncommitted voters from this area. The candidates will be asked questions by these voters on a topic of their choosing \u2014 anything they want to ask about. My job as moderator is to, you know, take care of the questioning, ask questions myself if I think there needs to be continuity and balance, and sometimes I might ask the candidates to respond to what another candidate may have said."}

And they\u2019ll gridlock right at that point because for example, we\u2019ve got international competitors who simply could not unload their cars off the ships if they had to comply \u2014 you see, if it was a 2-way street, just couldn\u2019t do it.

I finally got \u2019em for 12 to 15 years. And I said, well, how does it stop being disruptive? And that is when their jobs come up from a dollar an hour to $6 an hour, and ours go down to $6 an hour; then it\u2019s leveled again, but in the meantime you\u2019ve wrecked the country with these kind of deals.

And if indeed all the jobs were going to move south because there are lower wages, there are lower wages now and they haven\u2019t done that. And so I have just negotiated with the president of Mexico the North American Free Trade Agreement \u2014 and the prime minister of Canada, I might add \u2014 and I want to have more of these free trade agreements, because export jobs are increasing far faster than any jobs that may have moved overseas. That\u2019s a scare tactic, because it\u2019s not that many. But any one that\u2019s here, we want to have more jobs here. And the way to do that is to increase our exports."}

Let me just mention three things very quickly.

In the real world, that is, outside of Washington, DC, compensation and achievement are based on goals defined and achieved. My question is about the deficit. Would you define in specific dollar goals how much you would reduce the deficit in each of the 4 years of a Clinton administration and then enter into a legally binding contract with the American people, that if you did not achieve those goals that you would not seek a 2nd term?

And I\u2019ll tell you exactly why. Because the deficit now has been building up for 12 years. I\u2019ll tell you exactly what I think can be done. I think we can bring it down by 50% in 4 years and grow the economy. Now, I could get rid of it in 4 years in theory on the books now, but to do it you\u2019d have to raise taxes too much and cut benefits too much to people who need them and it would even make the economy worse."}

So my view is, sir, you have to increase investment, grow the economy and reduce the deficit by controlling health care costs, prudent reductions in defense, cuts in domestic programs and asking the wealthiest Americans and foreign corporations to pay their fair share of taxes and investing and growing this economy."}

You see, I don\u2019t think the American people are taxed too little. I think they\u2019re taxed too much. I went for one tax increase and when I make a mistake I admit it.

So let me try to answer you in this way. Let\u2019s start with a premise. We spend 30% more of our income than any nation on earth on health care, and yet we insure fewer people. We have 35 million people without any insurance at all \u2014 and I see them all the time. A hundred thousand Americans a month have lost their health insurance just in the last 4 years."}

Number one, we spend at least $60 billion a year on insurance, administrative cost, bureaucracy, and government regulation that wouldn\u2019t be spent in any other nation. So we have to have, in my judgment, a drastic simplification of the basic health insurance policies of this country, be very comprehensive for everybody."}

No. One thing to blame is these malpractice lawsuits. They\u2019re breaking the system. It costs $20-25 billion a year, and I want to see those outrageous claims capped. Doctors don\u2019t dare to deliver babies sometimes because they\u2019re afraid that somebody\u2019s going to sue them. People don\u2019t dare \u2014 medical practitioners, to help somebody along the highway that are hurt because they\u2019re afraid that some lawyer\u2019s going to come along and get a big lawsuit.

A great big company can buy \u2014 Ross has got a good-sized company, been very successful. He can buy insurance cheaper than Mom and Pop\u2019s store on the corner.
