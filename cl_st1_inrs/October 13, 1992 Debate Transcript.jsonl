However, if a president should die in office, or is unable to serve for any other reason, the vice president automatically becomes president, and that has happened 5 times in this century."}

And, you know, talking about this point of concentrating on every other country in the world as opposed to the people of our country right here at home, when George Bush took former Secretary of State Baker out of the State Dept and put him in charge of the campaign and made him chief of staff in the White, Mr. Baker, who\u2019s quite a capable man, said that for these last 4 years George Bush was working on the problems of the rest of the world and in the next 4 years he would target America. Well, I want you to know we really appreciate that. But Bill Clinton and I will target America from day one. We won\u2019t wait 4 years before we concentrate on the problems in this country. He went on to say that it\u2019s really amazing what George Bush can do when he concentrates. Well, it\u2019s time that we had a president like Bill Clinton who can concentrate and will concentrate and work on the problems of real people in this country. You know, our country is in trouble. We simply cannot continue with this philosophy of giving huge tax cuts to the very wealthy, raising taxes on middle income families the way Bush and Quayle have done and then waiting for it to work.

And is it a negative attack and a personal attack to point out that Bill Clinton simply has trouble telling the truth? He said that he didn\u2019t even demonstrate \u2014 he told the people in Arkansas in 1978. Then we find out he organized demonstrations. You know, I don\u2019t care whether he demonstrated or didn\u2019t demonstrate. The fact \u2014 the question is, tell the truth. Just tell us the truth. Today, Bill Clinton \u2014 excuse me \u2014 yesterday in Philadelphia on a radio show, just yesterday on a radio show, he attacked \u2014 Admiral, he attacks Ross Perot saying the media is giving Ross Perot a free ride. The press asked him when the klieg lights are on, said what do you mean by Ross Perot getting a free ride? He says I didn\u2019t say that at all."}

No, I don\u2019t think that is a personal attack. What I find troubling with Bill Clinton is he can\u2019t tell the truth. You cannot lead this great country of ours by misleading the people."}

He is, as I have read in more than one article, a revolutionary; he\u2019s got plans out there that are going to double the speed at which this budget problem is being cared for. It was asked how, if we would squeeze down so fast that we would strangle the economy in the process. That is an art, to follow all those variables and know when to let up and to nurse this economy back together with pulls and pushes."}

And so I think that my closing statement is that I think I\u2019m in a room with people that aren\u2019t the life of reality. The US is in deep trouble. We\u2019ve got to have somebody that can get up there and bring out the firehoses and get it stopped, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re about in the Perot campaign."}

I\u2019d like to use this closing statement to talk to you about a few people that I have met in these last 4 years. I think of a woman in Chicago when I was talking to parents about education where she stood up and said I\u2019m sick and tired of these schools in this city being nothing but a factory for failure. And that\u2019s why we support choice in education."}
