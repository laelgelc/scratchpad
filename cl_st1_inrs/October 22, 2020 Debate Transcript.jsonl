This debate will cover six major topics. At the beginning of each section, each candidate will have two minutes, uninterrupted, to answer my first question. The debate commission will then turn on their microphone only when it is their turn to answer, and the commission will turn it off exactly when the two minutes have expired. After that, both microphones will remain on, but on behalf of the voters, I\u2019m going to ask you to please speak one at a time. The goal is for you to hear each other and for the American people to hear every word of what you both have to say. And so with that, if you\u2019re ready, let\u2019s start."}

More than 40,000 Americans are in the hospital tonight with COVID, including record numbers here in Tennessee. And since the two of you last shared a stage, 16,000 Americans have died from COVID.

We closed up the greatest economy in the world in order to fight this horrible disease that came from China. It\u2019s a worldwide pandemic. It\u2019s all over the world. You see the spikes in Europe and many other places right now. If you notice, the mortality rate is down, 85%. The excess mortality rate is way down, and much lower than almost any other country. And we\u2019re fighting it and we\u2019re fighting it hard. There is a spike. There was a spike in Florida, and it\u2019s now gone. There was a very big spike in Texas, it\u2019s now gone. There was a very big spike in Arizona, it\u2019s now gone. And there were some spikes and surges in other places. They will soon be gone. We have a vaccine that\u2019s coming, it\u2019s ready. It\u2019s going to be announced within weeks, and it\u2019s going to be delivered. We have Operation Warp Speed, which is the military, is going to distribute the vaccine. I can tell you from personal experience that I was in the hospital, I had it. And I got better and I will tell you that I had something that they gave me \u2014 a therapeutic, I guess they would call it. Some people could say it was a cure. But I was in for a short period of time and I got better very fast or I wouldn\u2019t be here tonight. And now they say I\u2019m immune. Whether it\u2019s four months or a lifetime, nobody\u2019s been able to say that, but I\u2019m immune. More and more people are getting better. We have a problem that\u2019s a worldwide problem. This is a worldwide problem, but I\u2019ve been congratulated by the heads of many countries on what we\u2019ve been able to do with the \u2014 if you take a look at what we\u2019ve done in terms of goggles and masks and gowns and everything else, and in particular, ventilators. We\u2019re now making ventilators. All over the world, thousands and thousands a month, distributing them all over the world, it will go away and as I say, we\u2019re rounding the turn, we\u2019re rounding the corner, it\u2019s going away."}

If you hear nothing else I say tonight, hear this. Anyone who\u2019s responsible for not taking control \u2014 in fact, not saying, I take no responsibility, initially \u2014 anyone who is responsible for that many deaths should not remain as President of the United States of America. We\u2019re in a situation where there are thousands of deaths a day, a thousand deaths a day. And there are over 70,000 new cases per day. Compared to what\u2019s going on in Europe, as the New England Medical Journal said, they\u2019re starting from a very low rate. We\u2019re starting from a very high rate. The expectation is we\u2019ll have another 200,000 Americans dead by the time, between now and the end of the year. If we just wore these masks \u2014 the President\u2019s own advisors have told him \u2014 we could save 100,000 lives. And we\u2019re in a circumstance where the President, thus far, still has no plan. No comprehensive plan. What I would do is make sure we have everyone encouraged to wear a mask, all the time. I would make sure we move in the direction of rapid testing, investing in rapid testing. I would make sure that we set up national standards as to how to open up schools and open up businesses so they can be safe, and give them the wherewithal and financial resources to be able to do that. We\u2019re in a situation now where the New England Medical Journal \u2014 one of the serious, most serious journals in the whole world \u2014 said for the first time ever that this, the way this President has responded to this crisis has been absolutely tragic. And so folks, I will take care of this, I will end this, I will make sure we have a plan."}

Look, his own person who ran that for him who, as you know was his chief of staff, said \u2018It was catastrophic, it was horrible, we didn\u2019t know what we were doing.\u2019 Now he comes up and he tells us how to do this.

We have to thank him. And then what happened was, we started talking about using the Defense Act, to make sure we go out and get whatever is needed out there to protect people.

And I asked everyone else to take the pledge. I made it clear that any country, no matter who it is, that interferes in American elections will pay a price. They will pay a price. It has been overwhelmingly clear in this election \u2014 I won\u2019t even get into the last one \u2014 this election, that Russia has been involved. China has been involved to some degree, and now we learned that, that Iran is involved. They will pay a price if I\u2019m elected. They\u2019re interfering with American sovereignty. That\u2019s what\u2019s going on right now. They\u2019re interfering with American sovereignty. And to the best of my knowledge, I don\u2019t think the President has said anything to Putin about it.

We are in a situation where we have foreign countries trying to interfere in the outcome of our election.

And then you find out that everything is going on here about Russia is wanting to make sure that I do not get elected the next President of the United States because they know I know them, and they know me. I don\u2019t understand why this President is unwilling to take on Putin when he\u2019s actually paying bounties to kill American soldiers in Afghanistan, when he\u2019s engaged in activities that are trying to destabilize all of NATO. I don\u2019t know why he doesn\u2019t do it but it\u2019s worth asking the question. Why isn\u2019t that being done?

Joe got three and a half million dollars from Russia. And it came through Putin, because he was very friendly with the former mayor of Moscow and it was the mayor of Moscow\u2019s wife. You got three and a half million dollars. Your family got three and a half million dollars and you know someday, you\u2019re gonna have to explain \u2014 why did you get three and a half? I never got any money from Russia. I don\u2019t get money from Russia. Now, about your thing last night, I knew all about that, and through John \u2014 who is John Radcliffe, who is fantastic, DNI \u2014 he said, the one thing that\u2019s common to both of them, they both want you to lose. Because there has been nobody tougher to Russia. Between the sanctions, nobody tougher than me on Russia. Between the sanctions between all of what I\u2019ve done with NATO. You know, I\u2019ve got the NATO countries to put up an extra 130 billion, going to $420 billion a year, that\u2019s to guard against Russia. I sold \u2014 while he was selling pillows and sheets \u2014 I sold tank busters to Ukraine. There has been nobody tougher on Russia than Donald Trump. And I\u2019ll tell you, they were so bad. They took over the, the submarine port. You remember that very well during your term, during you and Barack Obama. They took over a big part of what should have been Ukraine. You handed it to them. But you were getting a lot of money from Russia. They were paying you a lot of money and they probably still are, but now, with what came out today, it\u2019s even worse. All of the emails, the emails are horrible. The emails of the kind of money that you were raking in, you and your family. And Joe, you were vice president when some of this was happening. And it should have never happened. And I think you owe an explanation to the American people. Why is it, somebody just had a news conference a little while ago, who was essentially supposed to work with you and your family, but what he said was damning. And regardless of me, I think you have to clean it up and talk to the American people. Maybe you can do it right now."}

Over 20 million Americans get their health insurance through the Affordable Care Act. It\u2019s headed to the Supreme Court, and your administration, Mr. President, is advocating for the court to overturn it. If the Supreme Court does overturn that law, those 20 million Americans could lose their health insurance almost overnight.

Through the legislature, I terminated the individual mandate. That is the worst part of Obamacare, as we call it. The individual mandate \u2013 where you have to pay a fortune for the privilege of not having to pay for bad health insurance. I terminated it; it\u2019s gone. Now it\u2019s in court, because Obamacare is no good. But then I made a decision, \u2018Run it as well as you can\u2019 \u2014 to my people, great people \u2014 \u2018Run it as well as you can.\u2019 I could have gone the other route and made everybody very unhappy. They ran it. Premiums are down, everything\u2019s down. Here\u2019s the problem. No matter how well you run it, it\u2019s no good. What we\u2019d like to do is terminate it. We have the individual mandate done. I don\u2019t know that it\u2019s going to work. If we don\u2019t win, we will have to run it and we\u2019ll have Obamacare, but it will be better run. But it no longer is Obamacare. Because without the individual mandate, it\u2019s much different. Pre-existing conditions will always stay. What I would like to do is a much better health care, much better. We\u2019ll always protect people with pre-existing \u2014 so I\u2019d like to terminate Obamacare, come up with a brand new beautiful health care. The Democrats will do it because there\u2019ll be tremendous pressure on them. And we might even have the House by that time. And I think we\u2019re going to win the House, okay? You\u2019ll see, but I think we\u2019re gonna win the House. But come up with a better health care, always protecting people with pre-existing conditions \u2014 and one thing very important. We have 180 million people out there that have great private health care, far more than we\u2019re talking about with Obamacare. Joe Biden is going to terminate all of those policies. These are people that love their health care, people that have been successful \u2014 middle income people \u2014 been successful. They have 180 million plans, 180 million people, families under what he wants to do, which will basically be socialized medicine. He won\u2019t even have a choice. They want to terminate 180 million plans. We have done an incredible job on health care. And we\u2019re going to do even better."}

Public option is an option that says that if you, in fact, do not have the wherewithal to be \u2014 if you qualify for Medicaid, and you do not have the wherewithal in your state to get Medicaid, you automatically are enrolled, providing competition for insurance companies. That\u2019s what\u2019s going to happen. Secondly, we\u2019re going to make sure we reduce the premiums and reduce drug prices by making sure that there\u2019s competition that doesn\u2019t exist now by allowing Medicare to negotiate drug prices with the insurance companies. Thirdly, the idea that I want to eliminate private insurance \u2014 the reason why I had such a fight for, with 20 candidates for the nomination, was I support private insurance. That\u2019s why I did not \u2014 not one single person, private insurance, would lose their insurance under my plan, nor did they under Obamacare. They did not lose their insurance, unless they chose they wanted to go to something else. Lastly, we\u2019re going to make sure we\u2019re in a situation that we actually protect pre-existing \u2014 there\u2019s no way he can protect pre-existing conditions. None, zero, you can\u2019t do it in the ether. He\u2019s been talking about this for a long time. There is no \u2014 he\u2019s never come up with a plan. I guess we\u2019re gonna get the pre-existing condition plan the same time we get the infrastructure plan that we waited since 17, 18, 19, 20. The fact\u00a0 \u2014 I still have a little, a few more minutes, I know you\u2019re getting anxious \u2014 the fact is that he\u2019s already cost the American people because of his terrible handling of the COVID virus and economic spillover. 10 million people have lost their private insurance, and he wants to take away 22 million more people who have been under Obamacare, and over 110 million people with pre-existing conditions. And all the people from COVID are going to have pre-existing conditions. What are they gonna do?"}

What I didn\u2019t \u2014 I never had to tell my daughter if she\u2019s pulled over, make sure she puts, for a traffic stop, put both hands on top of the wheel. And don\u2019t reach for the glove box because someone may shoot you. But a Black parent, no matter how wealthy or how poor they are, has to teach their child, when you\u2019re walking down the street, don\u2019t have a hoodie on when you go across the street, making sure that you, in fact, if you get pulled over, yes sir, no sir, hands on top of the wheel. Because you are in fact, a victim, whether you\u2019re a person making 300,000 \u2014 $300,000-a-year person, or someone who\u2019s on food stamps. The fact of the matter is there is institutional racism in America. And we have always said \u2014 we\u2019ve never lived up to it. That we hold these truths to be self-evident, all men and women are created equal. But guess what \u2014 we have never ever lived up to it. But we have constantly been moving the needle further and further to inclusion, not exclusion. This is the first president come along and says that\u2019s the end of that. We\u2019re not going to do that anymore. We have to provide for economic opportunity, better education, better health care, better access to schooling, better access to opportunity to borrow money to start businesses. All the things we can do. And I\u2019ve laid out a clear plan as to how to do those things. Just to give people a shot. It\u2019s about accumulating the ability to have wealth, as well as it is to be free from violence."}

Now we\u2019re rebuilding it and we\u2019re doing record numbers, 11.4 million jobs in a short period of time etc. But, I will tell you, go back before the plague came in, just before, I was getting calls from people that were not normally people that would call me. They wanted to get together. We had the best Black unemployment numbers in the history of our country, Hispanic, women, Asian, people with diplomas, with no diplomas, MIT graduates, number one in the class \u2014 everybody had the best numbers. And you know what? The other side wanted to get together. They wanted to unify. Success is going to bring us together. We are on the road to success. But I\u2019m cutting taxes and he wants to raise everybody\u2019s taxes. And he wants to put new regulations on everything. He will kill it. If he gets in, you will have a depression, the likes of which you\u2019ve never seen. Your 401K\u2019s will go to hell and it\u2019ll be a very, very sad day for this country."}

I represent all of you whether you voted for me or against me. And I\u2019m going to make sure that you\u2019re represented. I\u2019m going to give you hope. We\u2019re going to move. We\u2019re going to choose science over fiction. We\u2019re going to choose hope over fear. We\u2019re going to choose to move forward because we have enormous opportunities, enormous opportunities to make things better. We can grow this economy. We can deal with systemic racism. At the same time, we can make sure that our economy is being run, and moved, and motivated by clean energy, creating millions of new jobs. And that\u2019s the fact, that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to do. And I\u2019m going to say, as I said at the beginning, what is on the ballot here is the character of this country. Decency. Honor. Respect. Treating people with dignity. Making sure that everyone has an even chance. Now, I\u2019m going to make sure you get that. You haven\u2019t been getting it the last four years."}
