I was not put on the ballot by either of the 2 parties; I was not put on the ballot by any PAC money, by any foreign lobbyist money, by any special interest money. This is a movement that came from the people. This is the way the framers of the Constitution intended our government to be, a government that comes from the people. Over time we have developed a government that comes at the people, that comes from the top down, where the people are more or less treated as objects to be programmed during the campaign with commercials and media events and fear messages and personal attacks and things of that nature. The thing that separates my candidacy and makes it unique is that this came from millions of people in 50 states all over this country who wanted a candidate that worked and belonged to nobody but them. I go into this race as their servant, and I belong to them. So this comes from the people."}

I don\u2019t have any experience in gridlock government where nobody takes responsibility for anything and everybody blames everybody else. I don\u2019t have any experience in creating the worst public school system in the industrialized world, the most violent crime-ridden society in the industrialized world. \u00c2\u00a0But I do have a lot of experience in getting things done. So, if we\u2019re at a point in history where we want to stop talking about it and do it, I\u2019ve got a lot of experience in figuring out how to solve problems, making the solutions work, and then moving on to the next one. I\u2019ve got a lot of experience in not taking 10 years to solve a 10-minute problem. So, if it\u2019s time for action, I think I have experience that counts. If there\u2019s more time for gridlock and talk and finger pointing, I\u2019m the wrong man."}

I think the press can play a huge roll in making sure that the backgrounds are clearly presented in an objective way. Then, make a decision. Certainly anyone in the White House should have the character to be there. But, I think it\u2019s very important to measure when and where things occurred. Did they occur when you were a young person, in your formative years? Or did they occur while you were a senior official in the federal government? When you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re a senior official in the federal government spending billions of dollars in taxpayer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s money and you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re a mature individual and you make a mistake, then that was on our ticket. If you make it as a young man, time passes. So I would say just, you know, look at all three of us. Decide who you think will do the job. Pick that person in November because believe me, as I\u2019ve said before, \u201cThe party\u2019s over and it\u2019s time for the clean-up crew.\u201d And we do have to have change and people who never take responsibility for anything when it happens on their watch and people who are in charge \u2014"}

That\u2019s going to take money for infrastructure and investment to do that. Our foreign competitors are doing it; we\u2019re not. We cannot pay off the $4 trillion debt, balance the budget and have the industries of the future and the high- paying jobs in this country without having the revenue. We\u2019re going to go through a period of shared sacrifice. There\u2019s one challenge. It\u2019s got to be fair.

But when the tables get turned, I ought to do my share. Right now we spend about $300 billion a year on defense, the Japanese spend around 30 billion in Asia, the Germans spend around 30 billion in Europe. For example, Germany will spend a trillion dollars building infrastructure over the next 10 years. It\u2019s kind of easy to do if you only have to pick up a $30-billion tab to defend your country. The European Community is in a position to pay a lot more than they have in the past. I agree with the president: when they couldn\u2019t, we should have; now that they can, they should. We sort of seem to have a desire to try to stay over there and control it. They don\u2019t want us to control it, very candidly. So it I think is very important for us to let them assume more and more of the burden and for us to bring that money back here and rebuild our infrastructure, because we can only be a superpower if we are an economic superpower; and we can only be an economic superpower if we have a growing, expanding job base."}

Now, if you study our international competitors, some of our international competitors collect up to $3.50 a gallon in taxes, and they use that money to build infrastructure and to create jobs. We collect 35 cents, and we don\u2019t have it to spend. I know it\u2019s not popular, and I understand the nature of your question. But the people who will be helped the most by it are the working people who will get the jobs created because of this tax. Why do we have to do it? Because we have so mismanaged our country over the years, and it is now time to pay the fiddler. And if we don\u2019t, we will be spending our children\u2019s money. We have spent $4 trillion worth. An incredible number of young people are active in supporting my effort because they are deeply concerned that we have taken the American dream from them. I think it\u2019s fitting that we\u2019re on the campus of a university tonight. These young people, when they get out of this wonderful university, will have difficulty finding a job. We\u2019ve got to clean this mess up, leave this country in good shape, and pass on the American dream to them. We\u2019ve got to collect the taxes to do it. If there\u2019s a fairer way, I\u2019m all ears (laughter) \u2013aah. (Laughter and applause) But\u2013but\u2013see, let me make it very clear. If people don\u2019t have the stomach to fix these problems, I think it\u2019s a good time to face it, November. If they do, then they will have heard the harsh reality of what we have to do.

Many of them are. And the sooner they start, the sooner they\u2019ll finish. And there will be a significant transition. And it\u2019s very important that we not continue to let our industrial base deteriorate. We had someone who I\u2019m sure regrets said it in the president\u2019s staff said he didn\u2019t care whether we made potato chips or computer chips. Well, anybody that thinks about it cares a great deal. Number one, you make more making computer chips than potato chips; and, number 2, 19 out of 20 computer chips that we have in this country now come from Japan. We\u2019ve given away whole industries. So as we phase these industries over, there\u2019s a whole of intellectual talent in these industries. A lot of these people in industries can be converted to the industries of tomorrow, and that\u2019s where the high-paying jobs are. We need to have a very carefully thought through phase-over. Now, see, we practice 19th century capitalism. The rest of the world practices 21st century capitalism. I can\u2019t handle that in a minute, but I hope we can get back into it later. In the rest of the world, the countries and the businesses would be working together to make this transition in an intelligent way."}

And we will start putting together teams to put together\u2013to take all the plans that exist and do something with them. Please understand. There are great plans lying all over Washington nobody ever executes. It\u2019s like having a blueprint for a house you never built. You don\u2019t have anywhere to sleep. Now our challenge is to take these things, do something with them. Step one, we want to put America back to work, clean up the small business problem, have one task force at work on that. The second, you\u2019ve got your big companies that are in trouble, including the defense industries\u2013have another one on that. Have a 3rd task force on new industries of the future to make sure we nail those for our country and they don\u2019t wind up in Europe and Asia. Convert from 19th to 21st century capitalism. See, we have an adversarial relationship between government and business. Our international competitors that are cleaning our plate have an intelligent relationship between government and business, and a supportive relationship. Then have another task force on crime because, next to jobs, our people are concerned about their safety. Health care, schools\u2013one on the debt and deficit. And finally in that 90- day period before the inauguration, put together the framework for the town hall and give the American people a Christmas present. Show them by Christmas the first cut at these plans. By the time Congress comes into session to go to work, have those plans ready to go in front of Congress. Then get off to a flying start in \u201993 to execute these plans. Now, there are people in this room and people on this stage who\u2019ve been in meetings when I would sit there and say, \u201cIs this the one we\u2019re going to talk about or do something about?\u201d Well, obviously, my orientation is let\u2019s go do it. Now, put together your plans by Christmas, be ready to go when Congress goes, nail these things. Small business\u2013you\u2019ve got to have capital, you\u2019ve got to credit, and many of them need mentors or coaches. And we can create more jobs there in a hurry than any other place."}

We live in a global economy, not a national economy. These interest rates we have now don\u2019t make any sense. We have a four trillion dollar debt, and only in America would you finance seventy percent of it five years or less. So seventy percent of our debt is five years or less. It\u2019s very interest sensitive. We have a four percent gap between what we pay for treasuries, and what Germany pays for one to five year treasuries. That gap is going to close, because the Arabs, the Japanese and folks in this country are going to start buying German treasuries because they can get more money. Every time our interest rates go up one percent, that adds 28 billion dollars to the deficit or to the debt. Whichever place you put it. We are sitting on a ticking time bomb folks, because we have totally mismanaged our country, and we had better get it back under control. Just think in your own business, if you had all of your long term problems financed short term. You\u2019d go broke in a hurry."}

So we have two that I\u2019d put as number one. I have number 1 and 1A. One is we\u2019ve got to have the money to be able to pay for defense, and we\u2019ve got to manufacture here. Believe it or not folks, you can\u2019t ship it all overseas, you\u2019ve got to make it here. And you can\u2019t convert from potato chips to airplanes in an emergency. See, Willow Run could be converted from cars to airplanes in World War II because it was here. We\u2019ve got to make things here. You can\u2019t ship them overseas anymore. I hope we can talk more about that. Second thing, on priorities. We\u2019ve got to help Russia succeed in its revolution and all of its republics. When we think of Russia, remember we\u2019re thinking of many countries, now. We\u2019ve got to help them. That\u2019s pennies on the dollar compared to renewing the cold war. Third, we\u2019ve got all kinds of agreements on paper, and some that are being executed on getting rid of nuclear warheads. Russia and its republics are out of control or at best in weak control right now. It\u2019s a very unstable situation. You\u2019ve got every rich Middle Eastern country over there trying to buy nuclear weapons. As you well know. And that will lead to another five star migraine headache down the road. We really need to nail down the big intercontinental ballistic missiles, the ones that can hit us from Russia. And we\u2019ve focused on the tactical. We\u2019ve made real progress there. We\u2019ve got some agreement on the nuclear, but we don\u2019t have those things put away yet. The sooner the better. So, in terms of priorities, we\u2019ve got to be financially strong. Number two, we\u2019ve got to take care of this missile situation and try to get the nuclear war behind us and give this thing very high priority. And number three, we need to help and support Russia and the republics in every possible way to become democratic capitalistic societies, and not just sit back and let those countries continue in turmoil. Because they could go back worse than things used to be. And believe me there are a lot of old boys in the K.G.B. and the military that liked it better the way it used to be."}

But time is our friend there, because their leaders will change in not too many years, worst case, and their country is making great progress. One last point on the missiles. I don\u2019t want the American people to be confused. We have written agreements and we have some missiles that have been destroyed, but we have a huge number of intercontinental ballistic missiles that are still in place in Russia. The fact that you have an agreement is one thing. Till they\u2019re destroyed, some crazy person can either sell them or use them."}

But it is inappropriate for us, just because there\u2019s a problem somewhere around the world, to take the sons and daughters of working people\u2013and make no mistake about it, our all- volunteer armed force is not made up of the sons and daughters of the beautiful people; it\u2019s the working folks who send their sons and daughters to war, with a few exceptions. It\u2019s very unlike World War II, when FDR\u2019s sons flew missions. Everybody went. It\u2019s a different world now.

A little child before they\u2019re 18 months learns to think well of himself or herself or poorly. They develop a positive or negative self- image. At a very early age they learn how to learn. If we have children who are not surrounded with love and affection \u2014 you see, I look at my grandchildren and wonder if they\u2019ll ever learn to walk because they\u2019re always in someone\u2019s arms. And I think, my gosh, wouldn\u2019t it be wonderful if every child had that love and support. But they don\u2019t. We will not be a great country unless we have a strong family unit in every home.

We\u2019ve got chemical warfare being conducted against our children on the streets in this country all day every day, and we don\u2019t have the will to stamp it out. Now, again, if I get up there, if you send me, we\u2019re going to have some blunt talks about this, and we\u2019re really going to get down in the trenches and say, is this one you want to talk about or fix, because talk won\u2019t do it, folks.

The first thing I\u2019d do is, during political campaigns, I would urge everybody to stop trying to split this country into fragments and appeal to the differences between us and then wonder why the melting pot is all broken to pieces after November the 3rd. We are all in this together. We ought to love one another because united teams win and divided teams lose. And if we can\u2019t love one another, we ought to get along with one another.

We have got to unite and pull together, and there\u2019s nothing we can\u2019t do. But if we sit around blowing all this energy out the window on racial strife and hatred, we are stuck with a sure loser because we have been a melting pot.

Now, all these fellows with thousand-dollar suits and alligator shoes running up and down the halls of Congress that make policy now \u2014 the lobbyists, the PAC guys, the foreign lobbyists, and what-have-you, they\u2019ll be over there in the Smithsonian, you know \u2014 (Laughter) \u2014 because we\u2019re going to get rid of them, and the Congress will be listening to the people.

We just have a bad system. We\u2019ve got to change the system. It\u2019s time to do it because we have run up so much debt that time is no longer our friend. We\u2019ve got to put our house in order. When you go to bed tonight, look at your children. Think of their dreams. Think of your dreams as a child and ask yourself, isn\u2019t it time to stop talking about it? Isn\u2019t it time to stop creating images? Isn\u2019t it time to do it? Aren\u2019t you sick of being treated like an unprogrammed robot? Every 4 years, they send you all kinds of messages to tell you how to vote and then go back to business as usual. They told you at the tax and budget summit that if you agreed to a tax increase, we could balance the budget. They didn\u2019t tell you that that same year they increased spending $1.83 for every dollar we increased taxes. That\u2019s Washington in a nutshell right there. In the final analysis, I\u2019m doing this for your children when you look at them tonight. There\u2019s another group that I feel very close to, and these at the men and women who fought on the battlefield, the children \u2014 the families \u2014 of the ones who died and the people who left parts of their bodies over there. I\u2019d never ask you to do anything for me, but I owe you this, and I\u2019m doing it for you. And I can\u2019t tell you what it means to me at these rallies when I see you and you come up and the look in your eyes \u2014 and I know how you feel and you know how I feel. And then I think of the older people who are retired. They grew up in the Depression. They fought and won World War II. We owe you a debt we can never repay you. And the greatest repayment I can ever give is to recreate the American dream for your children and grandchildren. I\u2019ll give you everything I have, if you want me to do it."}

We\u2019ve shipped millions of jobs overseas and we have a strange situation because we have a process in Washington where after you\u2019ve served for a while you cash in, become a foreign lobbyist, make $30,000 a month, then take a leave, work on presidential campaigns, make sure you\u2019ve got good contacts and then go back out. Now, if you just want to get down to brass tacks, first thing you ought to do is get all these folks who\u2019ve got these 1-way trade agreements that we\u2019ve negotiated over the years and say fellas, we\u2019ll take the same deal we gave you. And they\u2019ll gridlock right at that point because for example, we\u2019ve got international competitors who simply could not unload their cars off the ships if they had to comply \u2014 you see, if it was a 2-way street, just couldn\u2019t do it. We have got to stop sending jobs overseas. To those of you in the audience who are business people - pretty simple. If you\u2019re paying $12, $13, $14 an hour for a factory worker, and you can move your factory south of the border, pay $1 an hour for labor, hire a young \u2014 let\u2019s assume you\u2019ve been in business for a long time. You\u2019ve got a mature workforce. Pay $1 an hour for your labor, have no health care \u2014 that\u2019s the most expensive single element in making the car. Have no environmental controls, no pollution controls and no retirement. And you don\u2019t care about anything but making money. There will be a job-sucking sound going south. If the people send me to Washington the first thing I\u2019ll do is study that 2000-page agreement and make sure it\u2019s a 2-way street. One last point here. I decided I was dumb and didn\u2019t understand it so I called a \u201cWho\u2019s Who\u201d of the folks that have been around it, and I said why won\u2019t everybody go south; they said it will be disruptive; I said for how long. I finally got \u2019em for 12 to 15 years. And I said, well, how does it stop being disruptive? And that is when their jobs come up from a dollar an hour to $6 an hour, and ours go down to $6 an hour; then it\u2019s leveled again, but in the meantime you\u2019ve wrecked the country with these kind of deals. We got to cut it out."}

I\u2019m here tonight for these young people up here in the balcony from this college. When I was a young man, when I got out of the Navy I had multiple job offers. Young people with high grades can\u2019t get a job. People \u2014 the 18- to 24-year-old high school graduates 10 years ago were making more than they are now. In other words, we were down to 18% of them were making \u2014 18- to 24-year- olds were making less than $12,000. Now that\u2019s up to 40%. And what\u2019s happened in the meantime? The dollar\u2019s gone through the floor. Now, whose fault is that? Not the Democrats. Not the Republicans. Somewhere out there there\u2019s an extraterrestrial that\u2019s doing this to us, I guess.

If you want me to be your president, we\u2019re going to face our problems. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll deal with our problems, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll solve our problems. We\u2019ll down our debt.

But since they\u2019re bred from childhood to fight with one another rather than get results, you know, I would be glad to drop out and spend a little time and see if we couldn\u2019t build some bridges. Now, results is what counts. The president can\u2019t order Congress around. Congress can\u2019t order the president around. That\u2019s not bad for a guy that\u2019s never been there, right? But you have to work together. Now, I have talked to the chairmen of the committees that want this. They\u2019re Democrats. The president wants it, but we can\u2019t get it because we sit here in gridlock because it\u2019s a campaign year. We didn\u2019t fund a lot of other things this year, like the savings and loan mess. That\u2019s another story that we\u2019re going to pay a big price for right after the election. The facts are though \u2014 the facts are \u2014 the American people are hurting. These people are hurting in the inner cities. We\u2019re shipping the quote, \u201clow paying jobs\u201d overseas. What are low paying jobs? Textiles, shoes, things like that that we say are yesterday\u2019s industries. They\u2019re tomorrow\u2019s industries in the inner cities. Let me say in my case, if I\u2019m out of work, I\u2019ll cut grass tomorrow to take care of my family; I\u2019ll be happy to make shoes, I\u2019ll be happy to make clothing, I\u2019ll make sausage. You just give me a job. Put those jobs in the inner cities instead of doing diplomatic deals and shipping them to China where prison labor does the work."}

Now, what it really boils down to is can you live \u2014 we become so preoccupied with the rights of the criminal that we\u2019ve forgotten the rights of the innocent. And in our country we have evolved to a point where we\u2019ve put millions of innocent people in jail because you go to the poor neighborhoods and they\u2019ve put bars on their windows and bars on their doors and put themselves in jail to protect the things that they acquired legitimately. That\u2019s where we are. We have got to become more concerned about people who play by the rules and get the balance we require. This is going to take first, building a consensus at grassroots America. Right from the bottom up, the American people have got to say they want it. And at that point, we can pick from a variety of plans and develop new plans. And the way you get things done is bury yourselves in the room with one another, put together the best program, take it to the American people, use the electronic town hall, the kind of thing you\u2019re doing here tonight, build a consensus and then do it and then go on to the next one.

Twelve percent of our gross national product goes to health care. Our industrial competitors, who are beating us in competition, spend less and have better health care.

You\u2019ve bought a front row box seat and you\u2019re not happy with your health care and you\u2019re saying tonight we\u2019ve got bad health care but very expensive health care. Folks, here\u2019s why. Go home and look in the mirror. You own this country but you have no voice in it the way it\u2019s organized now, and if you want to have a high risk experience, comparable to bungee jumping, go into Congress some time when they\u2019re working on this kind of legislation, when the lobbyists are running up and down the halls. Wear your safety toe shoes when you go. And as a private citizen, believe me, you are looked on as a major nuisance. The facts are you now have a government that comes at you. You\u2019re supposed to have a government that comes from you. Now, there are all kinds of good ideas, brilliant ideas, terrific ideas on health care. None of them ever get implemented because \u2014 let me give you an example. A senator runs every 6 years. He\u2019s got to raise 20,000 bucks a week to have enough money to run. Who\u2019s he gonna listen to \u2014 us or the folks running up and down the aisles with money, the lobbyists, the PAC money? He listens to them. Who do they represent? Health care industry. Not us. Now, you\u2019ve got to have a government that comes from you again. You\u2019ve got to reassert your ownership in this country and you\u2019ve got to completely reform our government. And at that point they\u2019ll just be like apples falling out of a tree. The programs will be good because the elected officials will be listening to \u2014 I said the other night I was all ears and I would listen to any good idea. I think we ought to do plastic surgery on a lot of these guys so that they\u2019re all ears, too, and listen to you. Then you get what you want, and shouldn\u2019t you? You paid for it. Why shouldn\u2019t you get what you want, as opposed to what some lobbyist cuts a deal, writes a little piece in the law and he goes through. That\u2019s the way the game\u2019s played now.

You have a raging debate about those plans. Then out of that debate, with leadership, comes consensus. Then, if the plans are huge and complex like health care, I would urge you to implement pilot programs. Like the old carpenter says measure twice, cut once. Let\u2019s make sure this thing\u2019s as good as we all think it is at the end of the meeting. Then finally, our government passes laws and freezes the plan in concrete. Anybody that\u2019s ever built a successful business will tell you you optimize, optimize, optimize after you\u2019ve put something into effect. The reason Medicare and Medicaid are a mess is we froze them. Everybody knows how to fix them. There are people all over the federal government, if they could just touch it with a screwdriver, could fix it. Now, back over here. See, we\u2019ve got a $4 trillion debt and only in America would you have $2.8 trillion of it or 70% of it financed 5 years or less. Now, that\u2019s another thing for you to think about when you go home tonight. You don\u2019t finance long-term debt with short-term money. Why did our government do it? To get the interest rates down. A 1% increase in interest rates in that $2.8 trillion is $28 billion a year. Now, when you look at what Germany pays for money and what we don\u2019t pay for money, you realize there\u2019s quite a spread, right, and you realize this is a temporary thing and there\u2019s going to be another sucking sound that runs our deficit through the roof. You know, and everybody\u2019s ducking it so I\u2019m gonna say it, that we are not letting that surplus stay in the bank. We are not investing that surplus like a pension fund. We are spending that surplus to make the deficit look smaller to you than it really is. Now, that \u2014 put you in jail in corporate America if you kept books that way but in government it\u2019s just kind of the way things are. That\u2019s because it comes at you, not from you. Now then, that money needs to be \u2014 they don\u2019t even pay interest on it. They just write a note for the interest."}

Russia is still very unstable; they could go back to square one, and worse. All the nuclear weapons are not dismantled. I am particularly concerned about the intercontinental weapons, the ones that can hit us. We\u2019ve got agreements, but they are still there. With all this instability and breaking into republics, and all the Middle Eastern countries going over there and shopping for weapons, we\u2019ve got our work cut out for us. So we need to stay right on top of that and constructively help them move toward democracy and capitalism. We have to have money to do that. We have to have our people at work. See, for 45 years we were preoccupied with the Red Army. I suggest now that our number one preoccupation is red ink and our country and we\u2019ve got to put our people back to work so that we can afford to do these things we want to do in Russia. We cannot be the policeman for the world any longer. We spent $300 billion a year defending the world. Germany and Japan spend around $30 billion a piece. If I can get you to defend me and I can spend all my money building industry that\u2019s a home run for me. Coming out of World War II it made sense. Now, the other superpowers need to do their part. I\u2019ll close on this point. You can\u2019t be a superpower unless you\u2019re an economic superpower. If we\u2019re not an economic superpower, we\u2019re a used to be and we will no longer be a force for good throughout the world. And if nothing else gets you excited about rebuilding our industrial base maybe that will because job one is to put our people back to work."}

And the first word you need to say in every city and state, and just draw a line in the sand, is public schools exist for the benefit of the children. You\u2019re going to see a lot of people fall over it, because any time you\u2019re spending $199 billion dollars a year, somebody\u2019s getting it. And the children get lost in the process. So that\u2019s step one. Keep in mind in 1960, when our schools were the envy of the world, we were spending $16 billion on them; now we spend more than any other nation in the world \u2014 199 billion a year \u2014 and rank at the bottom of the industrialized world in terms of education achievement. One more time you\u2019ve bought a front-row box seat and got a third-rate performance. This is a government that is not serving you. By and large it should be local \u2014 the more local, the better. Interesting phenomenon: small towns have good schools, big cities have terrible schools. The best people in a small town will serve on the school board; you get into big cities, it\u2019s political patronage, stepping stones \u2014 you get the job, give your relatives a janitor\u2019s job at $57,000 a year, more than the teachers make, and with luck they clean the cafeteria once a week. Now, you\u2019re paying for that. Those schools belong to you. And we put up with that. Now, as long as we put up with that, that\u2019s what you\u2019re going to get. And these folks are just dividing up 199 billion bucks and the children get lost. If I could wish for one thing for great public schools, it would be a strong family unit in every home \u2014 nothing will ever replace that. You say, well, gee, what are you going to do about that? Well, the White House is a bully pulpit, and I think we ought to be pounding on the table every day. There\u2019s nothing \u2014 the most efficient unit of government the world will ever know is a strong loving family unit. Next thing. You need small schools, not big schools. In a little school everybody is somebody; individualism is very important. These big factories? Everybody told me they were cost-effective. I did a study on it; they\u2019re cost- ineffective. 5000 students \u2014 why is a high school that big? One reason. Sooner or later you get 11 more boys that can run like the devil that weigh 250 pounds and they might win district. Now, that has nothing to do with learning. Secondly, across Texas, typically half of the school day was non-academic pursuits \u2014 in one place it was 35%. In Texas you could have unlimited absences to go to livestock shows. Found a boy \u2014 excuse me, but this gives the flavor \u2014 a boy in Houston kept a chicken in the bathtub in downtown Houston and missed 65 days going to livestock shows. Finally had to come back to school, the chicken lost its feathers. That\u2019s the only way we got him back. (Laughter) Now, that\u2019s your tax money being wasted. Now, neighborhood schools. It is terrible to bus tiny little children across town. And it is particularly terrible to take poor tiny little children and wait until the first grade and bus them across town to Mars, where the children know their numbers, know their letters, have had every advantage. At the end of the first day, that little child wants out. I\u2019ll close on this. You\u2019ve got to have world class teachers, world class books. If you ever got close to how textbooks were selected, you wouldn\u2019t want to go back the second day. I don\u2019t have time to tell you the stories."}

Congress \u2014 they\u2019re all good people. They\u2019re all patriots but you\u2019ve got to link arms and work with them. Sure, you\u2019ll have arguments. Sure, you\u2019ll have fights. We have them all day every day. But we get the job done. Now, I have to come back in my clothes to one thing because I am passionate about education. I was talking about early childhood education for disadvantaged little children. And let me tell you one specific pilot program where children who don\u2019t have a chance go to this program when they\u2019re 3. Now we\u2019re going back to when the mother\u2019s pregnant and they\u2019ll start right after they\u2019re born. Starting when they\u2019re 3 and going to this school until they\u2019re 9 and then going into the public school in the 4th grade. Ninety percent are on the honor role. Now that will change America. Those children will all go to college. They will live the American dream. And I beg the American people, any time they think about reforming education to take this piece of society that doesn\u2019t have a chance and take these little pieces of clay that can be shaped and molded and give them the same love and nurture and affection and support you give your children and teach them that they\u2019re unique and that they\u2019re precious and that there\u2019s only one person in the world like them and you will see this nation bloom. And we will have so many people who are qualified for the top job that it will be terrific. Now, finally, if you can\u2019t pay the bills you\u2019re dead in the water. And we have got to put our nation back to work. Now, if you don\u2019t want to really do that I\u2019m not your man. I\u2019d go crazy sitting up there slow dancing that one.

If you forecast it out, we still have a significant deficit under each of their plans, as I understand them. Our challenge is to stop the financial bleeding. If you take a patient into the hospital that\u2019s bleeding arterially, step one is to stop the bleeding. And we are bleeding arterially. There\u2019s only one way out of this, and that is to stop the deterioration of our job base, to have a growing, expanding job base, to give us the tax base \u2014 see, balancing the budget is not nearly as difficult as paying off the $4 trillion debt and leaving our children the American dream intact. We have spent their money. We\u2019ve got to pay it back. This is going to take fair, shared sacrifice. My plan balances the budget within 6 years. We didn\u2019t do it faster than that because we didn\u2019t want to disrupt the economy. We gave it off to a slow start and a fast finish to give the economy time to recover.

You\u2019ve had a number of occasions to see in detail what the plan is, and at least you\u2019ll understand it. I think that\u2019s fundamental in our country, that you know what you\u2019re getting into."}

I did everything I could to get General Motors to face its problems in the mid-\u201980s while it was still financially strong. They just wouldn\u2019t do it, and everybody now knows the terrible price they\u2019re paying by waiting until it\u2019s obvious to the brain-dead that they have problems. Now, hundreds, thousands of good, decent people, whole cities up here in this state are adversely impacted because they would not move in a timely way. Our government is that point now. The thing that I am in this race for is to tap the American people on the shoulder and to say to every single one of you, fix it while we\u2019re still relatively strong. If you have a heart problem, you don\u2019t wait till a heart attack to address it. So the General Motors experience is relevant. At the point when I could not get them to address those problems, I had created so much stress in the board, who wanted to just keep the Lawrence Welk music going, that they asked to buy my remaining shares. I sold them my remaining shares. They went their way. I went my way because it was obvious we had a complete disagreement about what should be done with the company. But let\u2019s take my life in perspective. Again and again, on complex, difficult tasks, I have stayed the course. When I was asked by our government to do the POW project, within a year the Vietnamese had sent people into Canada to make arrangements to have me and my family killed. And I had 5 small children, and my family and I decided we would stay the course, and we lived with that problem for 3 years. Then I got into the Texas War on Drugs program and the big-time drug dealers got all upset. Then when I had 2 people imprisoned in Iran, I could have left them there. I could have rationalized it. We went over, we got them out, we brought them back home. And since then, for years, I have lived with the burden of the Middle East, where it\u2019s eye for an eye and tooth for a tooth country, in terms of their unhappiness with the fact that I was successful in that effort. Again and again and again, in the middle of the night, at 2 or 3 o\u2019clock in the morning, my government has called me to take extraordinary steps for Americans in distress, and again and again and again I have responded. And I didn\u2019t wilt and I didn\u2019t quit. Now, what happened in July we\u2019ve covered again and again and again. But I think in terms of the American people\u2019s concern about my commitment, I\u2019m here tonight, folks; I never quit supporting you as you put me on the ballot in the other 26 states; and when you asked me to come back in, I came back in. And talk about not quitting, I\u2019m spending my money on this campaign; the 2 parties are spending your money, taxpayer money. I put my wallet on the table for you and your children. Over $60 million at least will go into this campaign to leave the American dream to you and your children, to get this country straightened out, because if anybody owes it to you, I do. I\u2019ve lived the American dream; I\u2019d like for your children to be able to live it, too. (Laughter)"}

Let\u2019s go to the center of the bull\u2019s-eye, the core problem. And believe me, everybody on the factory floor all over this country knows it. You implement that NAFTA, the Mexican trade agreement, where they pay people a dollar an hour, have no health care, no retirement, no pollution controls, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera, and you\u2019re going to hear a giant sucking sound of jobs being pulled out of this country right at a time when we need the tax base to pay the debt and pay down the interest on the debt and get our house back in order. We\u2019ve got to proceed very carefully on that. See, there\u2019s a lot I don\u2019t understand. I do understand business. I do understand creating jobs. I do understand how to make things work. And I got a long history of doing that. Now, if you want to go to the core problem that faces everybody in manufacturing in this country, it\u2019s that agreement that\u2019s about to be put into practice. It\u2019s very simple. Everybody says it\u2019ll create jobs. Yes, it\u2019ll create bubble jobs. Now, you know, watch this \u2014 listen very carefully to this. One-time surge while we build factories and ship machine tools and equipment down there. Then year after year for decades, they will have jobs. And I finally \u2014 I thought I didn\u2019t understand it \u2014 called all the experts, and they said, oh, it\u2019ll be disruptive for 12 to 15 years. We haven\u2019t got 12 days, folks. We cannot lose those jobs. They were eventually saying, Mexican jobs will eventually come to $7.50 an hour, ours will eventually go down to $7.50 an hour. Makes you feel real good to hear that, right? Let\u2019s think it through here. Let\u2019s be careful. I\u2019m for free trade philosophically, but I have studied these trade agreements till the world has gone flat, and we don\u2019t have good trade agreements across the world. I hope we\u2019ll have a chance to get into that tonight, because I can get right to the center of the bull\u2019s-eye and tell you why we\u2019re losing whole industries in this country."}

This deal is terribly destructive to the US airline industry. One of the largest industries in the world is the travel and tourist business.

If the president has any interest tonight, I\u2019ll detail it to you; I won\u2019t take 10 minutes tonight. All these things take a few minutes. But that\u2019s happening as we sit here today. We hammerlock the American companies \u2014 American Airlines, Delta \u2014 the last few great we have, because we\u2019re trying to do this deal with these 2 European companies.

Both parties carry a huge blame for that on their shoulders. This was not a way to pay down the deficit. This was a trick on the American people. That\u2019s not leadership.

If you create Saddam Hussein, over a 10-year period, using billions of dollars of US taxpayer money, step up to the plate and say it was a mistake.

I suggest, in the sense of taking responsibility for your actions, we lay those papers on the table. They\u2019re not the secrets to the nuclear bomb. Secondly, we got upset when he took the whole thing, but to the ordinary American out there who doesn\u2019t know where the oil fields are in Kuwait, they\u2019re near the border. We told him he could take the northern part of Kuwait, and when he took the whole thing, we went nuts.

And talk to any head of any of those key committees in the Senate. They will not let them see the written instructions given to Ambassador Glaspie. And I suggest that in a free society owned by the people, the American people ought to know what we told Ambassador Glaspie to tell Saddam Hussein, because we spent a lot of money and risked lives and lost lives in that effort, and did not accomplish most of our objectives.

And then after the Republican dirty tricks group got through with me I\u2019m another person, which I consider an absolutely sick operation. And all of you in the press know exactly what I\u2019m talking about. They investigated every single one of my children. They investigated my wife. They interviewed all of my children\u2019s friends from childhood on. They went to extraordinary sick lengths, and I just found it amusing that they would take 2 or 3 cases where I was involved in lawsuits and would engage an investigator \u2014 the lawyers would engage an investigator, which is common. And the only difference between me and any other businessman that has the range of businesses that I have is I haven\u2019t had that many lawsuits. So that\u2019s just another one of those little fruit-loopy things they make up to try to, instead of facing issues, to try to redefine a person that\u2019s running against them. This goes on night and day. I will do everything I can, if I get up there, to make dirty tricks a thing of the past. One of the 2 groups has raised it to an art form. It\u2019s a sick art form. Now, let\u2019s go back to Saddam Hussein. We gave Ambassador Glaspie written instructions. That\u2019s a fact. We\u2019ve never let the Congress and the Foreign Relations, Senate Intelligence Committees see them. That\u2019s a fact. Ambassador Glaspie did a lot of talking right after July 25 and that\u2019s a fact and it\u2019s in all the newspapers. And you pull all of it at once and read it and I did, and it\u2019s pretty clear what she and Kelly and the other key guys around that thing thought they were doing. Then at the end of the war, when they had to go testify about it, their stories are a total disconnect from what they said in August, September and October. So I say this is very simple. Saddam Hussein released a tape, as you know, claiming it was a transcript of their meeting, where she said we will not become involved in your border dispute and, in effect, you can take the northern part of the country. We later said no, that\u2019s not true. I said well, this is simple. What were her written instructions? We guard those like the secrets of the atomic bomb, literally. Now, I say whose country is this? This is ours. Who will get hurt if we lay those papers on the table? The worst thing is, again, it\u2019s a mistake. Nobody did any of this with evil intent. I just object to the fact that we cover up and hide things. Whether it\u2019s Iran-contra, Iraq-gate or you name it, it\u2019s a steady stream."}

It\u2019s supposed to come from the people, it comes at the people. The people need to take their government back. You\u2019ve got to reform Congress, they\u2019ve got to be servants of the people again; you\u2019ve got to reform the White House. We\u2019ve got to turn this thing around. And it\u2019s a long list of specific items. And I\u2019ve covered it again and again in print and on television. But very specifically the key thing is to turn the government back to the people and take it away from the special interests and have people go to Washington to serve. Who can give themselves a 23% pay raise anywhere in the world except Congress? Who would have 1200 airplanes worth 2 billion a year just to fly around in? I don\u2019t have a free reserved parking place at Natl Airport, why should my servants? I don\u2019t have an indoor gymnasium and an indoor tennis and an indoor every other thing they can think of; I don\u2019t have a place where I can go make free TV to send to my constituents to try to brainwash them to elect me the next time. And I\u2019m paying for all that for those guys. I\u2019m going to be running an ad pretty soon that shows they promised us they were going to hold the line on spending at the tax and budget summit, and I\u2019m going to show how much they\u2019ve increased this little stuff they do for themselves. And it is silly putty, folks, and the American people have had enough of it. Step one, if I get up there, we\u2019re going to clean that up. You say, how can I get Congress to do that? I\u2019ll have millions of people at my shoulder, shoulder to shoulder with me, and we will see it done work speed \u2014 because it\u2019s wrong. We\u2019ve turned the country upside down."}

JOHN B. ANDERSON","Text":"Miss Loomis, I think it\u2019s very appropriate that the first question in this first debate of Campaign \u201980 should relate to the economy of the country, because it seems to me that the people who are watching us tonight \u2013 221 million Americans \u2013 are truly concerned about the poor rate of performance of the American economy over the last four years. Governor Reagan is not responsible for what has happened over the last four years, nor am I. The man who should be here tonight to respond to those charges chose not to attend. But I want to answer as specifically as I can the question that you have just put to me. Let me tell you that I, first of all, oppose an election year tax cut, whether it is the 10% across-the-board tax cut promised to the taxpayers by my opponent in this debate tonight, or whether it is the $27.5 billion tax cut promised on the 20th of August by President Carter. I simply think that when we are confronting a budget deficit this year \u2013 and this fiscal year will end in about 10 days, and we are confronted with the possibility of a deficit of $60 billion, perhaps as much as $63 billion \u2013 that that simply would be irresponsible. That, once again, the printing presses will start to roll; once again we will see the monetization of that debt result in a higher rate of inflation. Even though we\u2019ve seen some hopeful signs, perhaps, in the flash report on the third quarter, that perhaps the economy is coming out of the recession, we\u2019ve also seen the rise in the rate of the prime; we have seen mortgage rates back up again, a sure sign of inflation in the housing industry. What I would propose, and I proposed it way back in March when I was a candidate in my own state of Illinois, I proposed $11.3 billion, specifically, in cuts in the Federal budget. I think we\u2019ve got to have fiscal restraint. And I said at that time that one of the things that we could do, that perhaps would save as much as $5 billion to $7 billion, according, to one of the leading members of the House Budget Committee, was to recalculate the index that is used to determine the cost of living benefits that are paid to civil service retirees, to military retirees. That we ought to \u2026 in addition to that, we ought to pay those retirement benefits on the basis of once a year, rather than twice a year, and save $750 billion. In other words\u2026."}

MOYERS","Speaker":"ANDERSON","Text":"Mr. Movers, in addition to saying that this is no time for a tax cut, in view of the incipient signs of renewed inflation, in addition to calling for restraint in Federal spending, 15 months ago, I also suggested we ought to have an emergency excise tax on gasoline. I say that because I think, this year, we will send $90 billion out of this country to pay for imported oil, even though that. those imports have been reduced. And since I first made that proposal 15 months ago, the price of gasoline, which was then $.80, has gone up to about $1.30. In other words, we\u2019ve had a huge increase of about $.50 a gallon since that time, and all of that increase has gone out of this country \u2013 or much of it \u2013 into the pockets of OPEC oil producers. Whereas I have proposed we ought to take. put that tax on here at home, reduce our consumption of that imported oil. Recycle those proceeds, then, back into the pockets of the American workers by reducing their tax payments. their Social Security tax payments by 50%. That, I think, in addition, would be an anti-inflationary measure that would strengthen the economy of this country."}

MOYERS","Speaker":"ANDERSON","Text":"Well, Mr. Greenberg, I simply cannot allow to go unpassed the statements that have just been made by Mr. Reagan, who once again, has demonstrated, I think, a total misunderstanding of the energy crisis that confronts, not only this country, but the world, when he suggests that we have 27 years\u2019 supply of natural gas, 47 years\u2019 supply of oil, and all the rest, and that we really. all we have to do is to get the Government off the back of the oil industry, and that\u2019s going to be enough. I agree with what I think is the major premise of your question, sir, that we are going to have to create a new conservation ethic in the minds of the American people. and that\u2019s simply why I proposed, 15 months ago, the emergency excise tax on gasoline that I did. I did it as a security measure to be sure, because I would rather see us reduce the consumption of imported oil than have to send American boys to fight in the Persian Gulf. But at the same time, I think it\u2019s going to take a dramatic measure of that kind to convince the American people that we will have to reduce the use of the private automobile. We simply cannot have people sitting one behind the wheel of a car in these long traffic jams going in and out of our great cities. We are going to have to resort to van pooling, to car pooling. We\u2019re going to have to develop better community transportation systems, so that with buses and light rail, we can replace the private automobile in those places where it clearly is not energy-efficient. I think that, with respect to housing, when we are consuming, even though our per capita income today is about the same as that of the Federal Republic of Germany, we are consuming about, by a factor of two, the amount of energy that they consume in that country. Surely, there are things that we can do in the retrofitting, ;n the redesign of our homes, not only of our houses, but of our commercial structures, as well, that will make it possible for us to achieve. According to one study that was published a short time ago \u2013 the Harvard Business School study \u2013 indicated that just in the commercial sector alone of the economy, we could save between 30% and 40% of the energy that we consume in this country today. So I think, yes, we will have to change in a very appreciable way, some of the lifestyles that we now enjoy."}

And that is, that we cannot look at this as simply a national problem. Even though it\u2019s true that, perhaps, between now and the end of the decade, our total consumption of oil may not increase by more than, perhaps, a million or 2 million barrels of oil a day. The rest of the Western world, we are told, may see its consumption increase from 51 million barrels to about 66 million. And that additional 15 million barrels is going to cause scarcity. It is going to cause scarcity in world markets because there are at least five reputable studies, one even by the American Petroleum Institute itself, that, I think, clearly indicate that somewhere along around the end of the present decade, total world demand for oil is simply going to exceed total available supplies. I think that conservation \u2013 I think that a change in lifestyles \u2013 is necessary, and we had better begin to plan for that now rather than later."}

MOYERS","Speaker":"ANDERSON","Text":"Mr. Corddry, I am well aware of the present deficiencies in the Armed Forces of this country. When you have a report, as we did recently, that six out of 10 CONUS Divisions in this country \u2013 Continental United States Army Divisions \u2013 simply could not pass a readiness test: that two out of three divisions that were to be allocated to the so-called Rapid Deployment Force could not meet a readiness test. And in most cases, that failure to meet the test was because of a lack of manning requirements, an inability to fill many of the slots in those divisions. Yes, I have seen figures that indicate that perhaps as of September, 1980 \u2013 this very month \u2013 that there is a shortage of about 104,000 in the ranks between E-4 and E-9. And there were reports. public reports not long ago about ships that could not leave American ports because of a lack of crews. I talked to one of the leading former chiefs of Naval operations in my office a few weeks ago, who told me about 25,000 Chief Petty Officers being short. But, I think that that is clearly related to the fact that, going back to the time when the all-volunteer Army was created in 1973 \u2013 and I worked hard for it and supported it \u2013 we simply have failed to keep pace with the cost of living. And today, on the average, the average serviceman is at least 15% \u2013 and I happen to think that\u2019s a very modest estimate \u2013 15% below what has happened to the cost of living over that period of time. And as a result, the families of some of our young servicemen are on food stamps today. And I think that\u2019s shocking; it\u2019s shameful. So, yes, I told the American Legion National! Convention, the VFW National Convention \u2013 when I spoke to each of those bodies \u2013 I outlined a very specific program of increasing pay and allowances, reenlistment bonuses. That only makes sense. But I would leave you with this thought, sir, to be quite specific in my answer to your question: that, of course, to protect the vital interests of this country, if that became impossible; if I could not, despite the very best efforts that I asked the Congress to put forward, to raise those pay and incentives and allowances, of course, I would not leave this country go undefended."}

But, unlike Governor Reagan, I do not support a boondoggle like the MX missile. I\u2019ve just gotten a report from the Air Force that indicates that the 30-year lifecycle cost of that system is going to be $100 billion. The initial cost is about $54 billion, and then when you add in the additional costs \u2013 not only the construction of the system, the missiles and the personnel, and so on \u2013 when you add in the additional costs over the lifecycle of that system, over $100 billion.

MOYERS","Speaker":"ANDERSON","Text":"Mr. May, I recently saw a Princeton University study that indicated that the cities of America \u2013 the large cities of this country \u2013 are in worse shape today than they were in 1960. It seems to totally belie the claim that I heard President Carter make a few days ago, that he was the first President that had come forth with a real urban strategy to meet the problems of urban America. Incidentally, just this past week, the crown jewel in that program that he had devised was stolen, I guess, because a conference committee turned down the ambitious plan that he had to increase the amount of money that would be available to the Economic Development Administration for loan guarantees and direct loans and credits. I\u2019m happy to say that, in contrast to that, the Anderson-Lucey platform for America, program for the 80s, has devoted considerable time, and in very specific detail, we have talked about two things that ought to be done to aid urban America. We call, first of all, for the creation of a $4 billion urban reinvestment trust fund to do exactly what you spoke about in your question \u2013 to rebuild the streets, to rebuild the cities, the leaking water mains. I was in North Pittsburgh \u2013 I think it was a few weeks ago, on my campaign \u2013 the water mains in that city had begun to leak, and literally, there wasn\u2019t money available to fix them. And until we can begin to recreate the basic infrastructure of the great cities of America, particularly in the upper Midwest and in the Northeast, they simply are not going to provide the kind of economic climate that will enable them to retain industry, enable them to retain the kind of solid industrial base that they need, so that they can provide jobs. We have also provided in our program for a $4 billion Community Trust Fund, and we\u2019ve told you where the money is coming from. It\u2019s going to come from the dedication, by 1984, of the excise revenues that today are being collected by the Federal Government on alcohol and tobacco. That money, I think, ought to be put into rebuilding the base of our cities. In addition to that, jobs programs to re-employ the youth in our cities would be very high on my priority list, both the Youth Opportunities Act of 1980 and a billion-dollar program that I would recommend to put youth to work in energy projects, in conservation projects, in projects that would carry out some of the great national goals of our country."}

It seems to me that to deny the responsibility of the Federal Government to do something about our crumbling cities is to deny the opportunity for one thing: To 55% of the black population of our country that is locked within the inner cities of the metropolitan areas of our country. We simply cannot ignore the fact that, in those cities today, we have 55% youth unemployment among black and Hispanic youth. And why is that? It\u2019s because they have lost their industry. And why have they lost their industry? It\u2019s because they no longer present the kind of viable economic climate that makes it possible for industry to remain there, or to locate there. I think Government has a responsibility to find jobs for the youth of this country, and that the place to start is to assist in the very important and necessary task of helping cities rebuild."}

MOYERS","Speaker":"ANDERSON","Text":"Miss Quinn, I would be very happy to accept the challenge of your question tonight, to tell the voters of this country exactly what I think it\u2019s going to cost, because I believe that all too often in past elections, politicians have simply been promising people things that they cannot deliver. When these Presidential Debates were held just four years ago, I remember the incumbent President, who was willing to debate, President Ford, telling the American people that they simply ought not to vote for somebody who promised more than they could deliver. Well, we\u2019ve seen what has happened. We haven\u2019t gotten either the economies in Government that were promised; we haven\u2019t gotten the 4% inflation that we were supposed to get at the end of Mr. Carter\u2019s first term. Instead we had, I think, in the second quarter, a Consumer Price Index registering around 12%. And nobody really knows, with the latest increase in the Wholesale Price Index \u2013 that\u2019s about 18% on an annualized basis \u2013 what it\u2019s going to be. Let me say this. I think my programs are far less inflationary than those of Governor Reagan. His own running mate, when he was running for the Presidency, said that they would cost 30% inflation inside of two years, and he cited his leading economic advisor, a very distinguished economist, Paul Macavoy, as the source of that information. He went so far as to call it \u201cbrutal economics.\u201d I\u2019ve been very careful \u2013 I have been very careful in saying that what I\u2019m going to do is to bring Federal spending under control first. I would like to stand here and promise the American people a tax cut, as Governor Reagan has done. But, you know, it\u2019s gotten to be about $122 difference. Somebody worked it out. And they figured out that between the tax cut that Governor Reagan is promising the American people, and the tax cut that Jimmy Carter is promising in 198I, his is worth about $122 more. So you, dear voters, are out there on the auction block, and these two candidates are bidding for your votes. And one is going to give you $122 more if you happen to be in that range of about a $20,000-a-year income. I\u2019m going to wait until I see that that inflation rate is going down, before I even begin to phase in the business tax cuts that I\u2019ve talked about. But I think, by improving productivity, they would be far less inflationary than the consumption-oriented tax cut that Governor Reagan is recommending."}

But I do know that, despite his pledge to reduce state Government spending, that it rose from $4.6 billion when he took office in 1967, to $10.2 billion during his eight years in office. Spending, in other words. more than doubled, and it rose at a faster rate than spending was rising in the Federal Government. But on his very optimistic figures about his tax cut producing a balanced budget by 1983, and the fact that he is using, he says, the figures of the Senate Budget Committee, that Senate Budget Committee Report does not accommodate all of the Reagan defense plans. It doesn\u2019t accommodate the expenditures that he calls for, for accelerated development and deployment of a new manned strategic bomber, for a permanent fleet in the Indian Ocean, for the restoration of the fleet to 600 ships, to the development and deployment of a dedicated modern aircraft interceptor. In other words, I have seen his program costed out to the point where it would amount to more than $300 million a year, just for the military. And I think the figures that he has given are simply not going to stand up."}

But to try, as occurred in the case that you mentioned \u2013 that specific case \u2013 to try to tell the parishioners of any church, of any denomination, how they should vote, or for whom they should vote, I think violates the principle of separation of church and state. Now, Governor Reagan is running on a platform that calls for a Constitutional amendment banning abortion. I think that is a moral issue that ought to be left to the freedom of conscience of the individual. And for the state to interfere with a Constitutional amendment, and tell a woman that she must carry that pregnancy to term, regardless of her personal belief, that, I think, violates freedom of conscience as much as anything that I can think of. And he is also running on a platform that suggests a litmus test for the selection of judges \u2013 that only judges that hold a certain, quote, \u201cview,\u201d on the sanctity of family life, ought to be appointed to the Federal Judiciary, one of the three great independent branches of our Government. No. I believe in freedom of choice. I don\u2019t believe in Constitutional Amendments that would interfere with that. I don\u2019t believe in trying to legislate new tests for the selection of the Federal Judiciary. On the Amendment that you mentioned, I abandoned it 15 years ago. And I have said freely, all over this country, that it was a mistake for me or anyone to ever try to put the Judeo-Christian heritage of this country, important as it is, and important as my religious faith is to me \u2013 it\u2019s a very deeply personal matter. But for me to try, in this very pluralistic society of ours, to try to frame any definition, whatever, of what that belief should be, is wrong. And so, not once, but twice \u2013 in 1971 \u2013 I voted on the floor of the House of Representatives against a Constitutional amendment that tried to bring prayer back into the public schools. I think mother ought to whisper to Johnny and to Susie, as they button their coats in the morning and leave for the classroom, \u201cBe sure to say a prayer before you start your day\u2019s work.\u201d But I don\u2019t think that the state, the Board of Regents, a Board of Education, or any state official, should try to compose that prayer for a child to recite."}

And for the state to interfere in that decision, under whatever guise, and with whatever rationale, for the state to try to take over in that situation, and by edict, command what the individual shall do, and substitute itself for that individual\u2019s conscience, for her right to consult her rabbi, her minister, her priest, her doctor \u2013 any other counselor of her choice \u2013 I think goes beyond what we want to ever see accomplished in this country, if we really believe in the First Amendment: if we really believe in freedom of choice and the right of the individual."}
{"Title":"September 21, 1980 Debate Transcript","Debate":"The Anderson-Reagan Presidential Debate","Date":338342400000,"Participants":"Anderson-Reagan","Moderators":"MR. MOYERS","Speaker":"ANDERSON","Text":"Mr. Movers, President Carter was not right a few weeks ago when he said that the American people were confronted with only two choices, with only two men, and with only two parties. I think you\u2019ve seen tonight in this debate that Governor Reagan and I have agreed on exactly one thing \u2013 we are both against the reimposition of a peacetime draft. We have disagreed, I believe, on virtually every other issue. I respect him for showing tonight \u2013 for appearing here, and I thank the League of Women Voters for the opportunity that they have given me. I am running for President as an Independent because I believe our country is in trouble. I believe that all of us are going to have to begin to work together to solve our problems. If you think that I am a spoiler, consider these facts: Do you really think that our economy is healthy? Do you really think that 8 million Americans being out of work and the 50% unemployment among the youth of our country are acceptable? Do you really think that our armed forces are really acceptably strong in those areas of conventional capability where they should be? Do you think that our political institutions are working the way they should when literally only half of our citizens vote? I don\u2019t think you do think that. And therefore, I think you ought to consider doing something about it, and voting for an Independent in 1980. You know, a generation of office seekers has tried to tell the American people that they could get something for nothing. It\u2019s been a time, therefore, of illusion and false hopes, and the longer it continues, the more dangerous it becomes. We\u2019ve got to stop drifting. What I wish tonight so desperately is that we had had more time to talk about some of the other issues that are so fundamentally important. A great historian, Henry Steele Commager, said that in their lust for victory, neither traditional party is looking beyond November. And he went on to cite three issues that their platforms totally ignore: atomic warfare, Presidential Directive 59 notwithstanding. If we don\u2019t resolve that issue, all others become irrelevant. The issue of our natural resources; the right of posterity to inherit the earth, and what kind of earth will it be? The issue of nationalism \u2013 the recognition, he says, that every major problem confronting us is global, and cannot be solved by nationalism here or elsewhere \u2013 that is chauvinistic, that is parochial, that is as anachronistic as states\u2019 rights was in the days of Jefferson Davis. Those are some of the great issues \u2013 atomic warfare, the use of our natural resources, and the issue of nationalism \u2013 that I intend to be talking about in the remaining six weeks of this campaign, and I dare hope that the American people will be listening and that they will see that an Independent government of John Anderson and Patrick Lucey can give us the kind of coalition government that we need in 1980 to begin to solve our problems. Thank you."}
